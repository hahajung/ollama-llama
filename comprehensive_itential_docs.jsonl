General Field Definitions The following tables defines general field definitions used in schema files.\n| Field           | Required   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|:----------------|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| $id             | Yes        | This is the id/name of the schema and should be unique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| type            | No         | Used in several places, it is the data type associated with a specific schema item. If you want type validation, then this field should be provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| schema          | Yes        | This is the JSON schema specification used by the adapter‚Äôs schema file. The adapter uses Ajv to check the data against the schema so this specification should be one that is supported by Ajv.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| description     | No         | Used in many places, it is the description associated with a specific schema item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| translate       | No         | This field is an adapter specific field. It is available on any object type field. It tells the adapter library whether to run translation (or not) on the schema or object. Adapters will often be generated with an empty schema file and translation set to false as that is a simpler schema file. It defaults to true on the schema and is inherited from parents on objects within the schema. |\n| dynamicfields   | No         | This field is an adapter specific field. It is available on any object type field. It tells the adapter library whether to include any undefined fields in the data that it returns from the translator. It defaults to false on the schema and is inherited from parents on objects within the schema.                                                                                              |\n| properties      | Yes        | This field contains all the data fields within the schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ph_request_type | Yes        | This field is an adapter specific field. This property should be set in every adapter schema file. It is never included with the data but used internally by the adapter library. It should have an enum that includes every action that uses this schema file. The default is required here and should be set to one of those actions.                                                              |\n| default         | No         | Defines the default value for the data field. In the case of ph_request_type it must be one of the values in the enum. In general, be careful using default as it is possible to get data that you do not want inside your request/response. It is also best to be careful when using certain data rules (e.g., min/max). Make sure they are appropriate for the request/response.                   |\n| enum            | No         | Defines the values that a data field of type string can have. In the case of ph_request_type, it is important that enum include every action that uses this schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Property names  | No         | These refer to how the data should be presented to IAP. In the earlier example, IAP referred to IP addresses as ip_address. Accordingly, that means the value in this field would be ip_address. In the case of token requests, in most cases, there should be a username property and a password property.                                                                                          |\n| external_name   | No         | This field is added by the adapter. It is how the data should be presented to the system we are integrating with. In the prior example, System A referred to IP address as ip_addr. So for this field, the value would be set to ip_addr.                                                                                                                                                            |\nExample: General Field Definitions Security Field Definitions\n\nTable: The following tables defines general field definitions used in schema files.

One of the core strengths of the Itential Automation Platform (IAP) is the agile ability to establish integrations with other network applications, systems and devices by creating your own adapter using the Adapter Builder . As such, Itential is excited to introduce a specific library of technical resources that summarize the configurations and customizations available for adapter generation and integration, along with customized authentication, testing and troubleshooting the install and use of your newly built adapter. At Itential, the information we make available is frequently expanded and updated, so be sure to bookmark this site and check back often. Lastly, go over to the Itential Open Source repository to check out all the adapters that are available and to our product site to see how network connectivity to everything using IAP can enable your business. Authentication This resource describes some of the common ways to set-up adapter authentication to ensure two-way communication between your adapter and the other system. Additional supporting information and examples are also provided for complex methods such as OAUTH and encoding. View Resource Security This resource describes some of the security methods and authentication protocols that users will use to establish secure forms of communication between devices when making a request to an external system. View Resource IAP Service Instance Configurations Most of the flexibility that‚Äôs needed to configure your adapter is found in the property definition file, which is a JSON schema file that provides all your property data. This resource will guide you in making changes to your adapter properties, which is done through the Itential Automation Platform. Each property is defined and several examples are given on how properties are used. View Resource Endpoint Configurations To understand the integrations, endpoints and various actions your adapter can take with a system entity, use the resource information provided here on the action.json file. This section covers the field definitions used to define actions within an adapter, and gives you examples on how to modify the file for unique schemas and mock data that can be tested in standalone mode. Also, the adapter schema is used in defining the data that flows to and from an adapter. Since every action in an adapter can have a unique input and output, use the information in this resource to configure the data for each action in your adapter. View Resource Headers Sometimes external systems require certain headers on the API calls. The below article describes how these headers can be added to some or all calls. It also discusses the difference between static and dynamic headers. View Resource Mock Data Mock data is captured and stored in your adapter for purposes of standalone testing, but it won‚Äôt test for true authentication. To learn more about using mock data, use the information in this resource to format the mock data files and understand how best to capture responses (data) from the other system. View Resource Code Files The adapter code files provide the Runtime Libraries required for many instant capabilities such as translation, consistent error handling, metrics and encryption.

Yes No", "searchable_text": "Itential Technical Resources Updated on Jan 16, 2025 Published on Jan 25, 2023 Export PDF Prev Next A specific library of technical resources that summarize the configurations and customizations available for adapter generation and integration. One of the core strengths of the Itential Automation Platform (IAP) is the agile ability to establish integrations with other network applications, systems and devices by creating your own adapter using the Adapter Builder . As such, Itential is excited to introduce a specific library of technical resources that summarize the configurations and customizations available for adapter generation and integration, along with customized authentication, testing and troubleshooting the install and use of your newly built adapter. At Itential, the information we make available is frequently expanded and updated, so be sure to bookmark this site and check back often. Lastly, go over to the Itential Open Source repository to check out all the adapters that are available and to our product site to see how network connectivity to everything using IAP can enable your business. Authentication This resource describes some of the common ways to set-up adapter authentication to ensure two-way communication between your adapter and the other system. Additional supporting information and examples are also provided for complex methods such as OAUTH and encoding. View Resource Security This resource describes some of the security methods and authentication protocols that users will use to establish secure forms of communication between devices when making a request to an external system. View Resource IAP Service Instance Configurations Most of the flexibility that‚Äôs needed to configure your adapter is found in the property definition file, which is a JSON schema file that provides all your property data. This resource will guide you in making changes to your adapter properties, which is done through the Itential Automation Platform. Each property is defined and several examples are given on how properties are used. View Resource Endpoint Configurations To understand the integrations, endpoints and various actions your adapter can take with a system entity, use the resource information provided here on the action.json file. This section covers the field definitions used to define actions within an adapter, and gives you examples on how to modify the file for unique schemas and mock data that can be tested in standalone mode. Also, the adapter schema is used in defining the data that flows to and from an adapter. Since every action in an adapter can have a unique input and output, use the information in this resource to configure the data for each action in your adapter. View Resource Headers Sometimes external systems require certain headers on the API calls. The below article describes how these headers can be added to some or all calls. It also discusses the difference between static and dynamic headers. View Resource Mock Data Mock data is captured and stored in your adapter for purposes of standalone testing, but it won‚Äôt test for true authentication. To learn more about using mock data, use the information in this resource to format the mock data files and understand how best to capture responses (data) from the other system. View Resource Code Files The adapter code files provide the Runtime Libraries required for many instant capabilities such as translation, consistent error handling, metrics and encryption. The adapter.js file contains the methods which are exposed to the Itential Automation Platform. This resource will provide details on what‚Äôs in the adapter.js, as well as provide examples to help you understand how to make modifications to an adapter call.

If multiple downstream resources can report the same event, or if multiple Itential Platform instances are listening to events from the same downstream resource, multiple event messages may be broadcast in the Itential Platform event system for the same downstream occurrence. In this case, actions listening for those events will execute multiple times. In most cases, however, the desired behavior is to respond only once for each distinct occurrence. For example, event deduplication may be required if an instance of NSO is observed by a cluster of Itential Platform servers. In this scenario, each Itential Platform server will maintain its own individual connection to the NSO server. NETCONF events produced by the NSO server will be observed by all running instances of Itential Platform, resulting in multiple messages being generated in the Itential Platform event system for a single NETCONF event. In this case, Itential Platform event deduplication may be configured to ensure that only one message is emitted to the event bus so that there is only one response to the event from the system as a whole. Configuring Event Deduplication In the active Itential Platform profile, you will need to set the service config of each event producer which requires event deduplication. Once the active profile is configured to enable event deduplication, each service for which events are to be deduplicated must then be configured. The most important settings shown below are active and uniqueProps , which determine the on/off status of the feature, as well as the set of message properties that will be used to determine which messages are duplicates. The uniqueProps allow you to handpick the fields that will be used to evaluate if two events are to be regarded as duplicates. For example, if the values of the three fields specified below ( \"/value/device\" , \"/value/event\" , \"/value/timestamp\" ) are the same between two events, the event is considered as a duplicate. If any of these are different, then the events are not deduplicated. Below is a sample service config for eventDeduplication settings.

The library used to create a message digest uses the system's openssl utility to produce a result. uniqueProps The uniqueProps setting is used to tell the deduplication system which fields define a unique message. The fields specified in this property are used to extract a subset of the message which is then hashed to provide a unique value to the deduplication system. For example, if the uniqueProps property specifies the fields device , event and timestamp , the following messages will be considered as redundant to each other, and two of them will be dropped while the first is emitted through the event system. Code Block Example | Context: Section: uniqueProps | Code: { \"device\": \"ios1\", \"event\": \"CRASH\", \"timestamp\": 1592329817, \"remediation\": \"REBOOT\" } { \"device\": \"ios1\", \"event\": \"CRASH\", \"timestamp\": 1592329817, } { \"device\": \"ios1\", \"event\": \"CRASH\", \"timestamp\": 1592329817, \"region\": \"us-east-1\" } When using inclusive configuration (shown below as JSON Pointer Array and Inclusive Mask Object), it is mandatory that uniqueProps be specified explicitly. In the event that none of the specified fields are found in a message, it is considered unique and subsequent messages like it will not be deduplicated. JSON Pointer Array When uniqueProps is an array, it must contain a list of JSON pointer expressions. These expressions tell Itential Platform which properties should be used when comparing messages, forming an inclusive list. Code Block Example | Context: Section: JSON Pointer Array | Code: [ \"/value/device\", \"/value/event\", \"/value/timestamp\" ] Inclusive Mask Object The uniqueProps setting may also be specified as an object with true or false as its leaf values (example below). In this form, uniqueProps acts as a 'mask' object. Keep in mind, true and false leaf values may not be mixed, as this causes ambiguity in the mask object in some situations.

There are several feature benefits to deploying installation of the Platform in this way, namely: Consolidated Startup Configuration : All startup configuration is now in a single location. User-Defined Environmental Variables : Platform 6 can be configured entirely through environmental variables, including an encryption key. Intelligent Default Values : Itential Platform will automatically generate and pre-fill default common values if a customer does not fully configure their system. Hierarchical Configuration: Configuration will follow a hierarchy that allows customers to configure once and deploy to several locations. Default User : Enable customers to login and configure Itential Platform without first setting up Local AAA (default user). Another improvement to the experience of installing and configuring Itential Platform is the efficiency gain of time and resources during upgrades. Additionally, having this new install allows users to define their own Encryption Key, and provide that key within environmental variables, or via the on-disk properties document. Lastly, these start up features are inherent to Platform 6 and require no installation. Configuration In previous Itential Platform releases, configuration was delegated between a properties.json file and a profile configured within MongoDB. Starting with the Platform 6 release, Itential Platform is now primarily configured through Environment Variables or a functionally equivalent platform.properties configuration file. This functionality replaces the legacy properties.json file. As such,configuration via properties.json is fully deprecated in Platform 6. Starting with Platform 6, the bin installer will no longer copy over the previous properties.json file. To migrate a properties.json file into a new platform.properties file, run this command: YAML Configuration Example | Context: Section: Configuration | Context: Starting with Platform 6, the bin installer will no longer copy over the previous properties.json file. To migrate a properties.json file into a new platform.properties file, run this command: | Code: npm run migrate:properties -- --json-file=<path> --out-file=<path> The file generated by this script includes commented out defaults and descriptions for all excluded properties. Itential Platform can be supplied a platform.properties file (or a properties.json ) with the --config-file=<path> launch option. If no --config-file argument is given, Itential Platform will first look in /etc/itential/platform.properties , then the Platform installation directory for a properties.json . If neither file exists, defaults will be used for all configurations not defined by Environment Variables. Profiles are also no longer required for configuration. It is best practice in Platform 6 to use Profiles only for configurations that may change while the server is running, such as prebuiltProps . Additionally, if no configuration for a property exists, Platform 6 will now supply a sensible default value. When conflicting configuration properties are provided, they are resolved in the following priority order: Environment Variable Configuration File Profile Default Value This hierarchy allows users to make a reusable Configuration File and override any necessary properties with Environment Variables for deployment. To view the current configuration in Platform 6, navigate to the Itential Platform ‚Üí Admin Essentials ‚Üí Configuration page . From this page view, all configuration properties, their values and their origins are shown (Figure 1).

Platform 6 now enables a default user account to log in and configure any necessary AAA adapters through Admin Essentials. The default user can be configured with the following variables. [TABLE_0] | platform.properties | Environment Variable | Type | |:----------------------|:-------------------------------|:--------| | default_user_enabled | ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_ENABLED | Boolean | | default_user_username | ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_USERNAME | String | | default_user_password | ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD | String | The primary purpose of the default user is only to set up the first admin account. Once any AAA/SSO adapter is enabled, the default user will be disabled from logging in again, and the Platform should be restarted. Status Page Prior to Platform 6, the Profiles page in Admin Essentials contained ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdapters‚Äù, ‚ÄúConfigure‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIndexing‚Äù tabs. Now that Itential Platform can now run without a Profile, the ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdapters‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIndexing‚Äù tabs were moved for accessibility. The Profiles page in Admin Essentials now only contains the contents of the ‚ÄúConfigure‚Äù tab. As implied by the location, any configuration done inside of a Profile will only affect that Profile; there is no way to modify a Config File or Environment Variables in Admin Essentials. The contents of the three moved tabs (‚ÄúApplications‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdapters‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIndexing‚Äù) can be found on the new Status page. These moved tabs still provide the same information and controls as before; Applications gives status information of all configured Platform services, Adapters gives information about configured Adapters, and Indexing gives the status of the MongoDB indexing. Limitations Some known limitations associated with the Platform 6 configuration include: Profiles are still only accessible after connecting to MongoDB. Any configuration related to MongoDB (including encryption) cannot be defined within a Profile. Any Configuration setting that captures the Platform state must only exist in a Profile document. As of Platform 6, the only stateful property is prebuiltProps . The switchActiveProfile API has been deprecated. Switching profiles is only possible when Itential Platform has been configured with a deprecated properties.json file. Environment Variables and Config Files are only read when Itential Platform starts. You must restart the platform to see changes in configuration. Itential Platform will never automatically modify the contents of your platform.properties file or your Environment Variables. Any changes to your platform.properties file must be done outside of the Platform. The Default User is only able to log in before any AAA/SSO Adapter is configured. Once a qualifying Adapter is running, Itential Platform will not accept new logins by the default user, though active sessions with this user may continue to function. Only one configuration file may be supplied to the Platform. If there is both a file at /etc/itential/platform.properties , a legacy properties.json in the installation directory, and no --config-file option is supplied, only the platform.properties file will be used, as it is the first location checked.

There are several feature benefits to deploying installation of the Platform in this way, namely: Consolidated Startup Configuration : All startup configuration is now in a single location. User-Defined Environmental Variables : Platform 6 can be configured entirely through environmental variables, including an encryption key. Intelligent Default Values : Itential Platform will automatically generate and pre-fill default common values if a customer does not fully configure their system. Hierarchical Configuration: Configuration will follow a hierarchy that allows customers to configure once and deploy to several locations. Default User : Enable customers to login and configure Itential Platform without first setting up Local AAA (default user). Another improvement to the experience of installing and configuring Itential Platform is the efficiency gain of time and resources during upgrades. Additionally, having this new install allows users to define their own Encryption Key, and provide that key within environmental variables, or via the on-disk properties document. Lastly, these start up features are inherent to Platform 6 and require no installation. Configuration In previous Itential Platform releases, configuration was delegated between a properties.json file and a profile configured within MongoDB. Starting with the Platform 6 release, Itential Platform is now primarily configured through Environment Variables or a functionally equivalent platform.properties configuration file. This functionality replaces the legacy properties.json file. As such,configuration via properties.json is fully deprecated in Platform 6. Starting with Platform 6, the bin installer will no longer copy over the previous properties.json file. To migrate a properties.json file into a new platform.properties file, run this command: YAML Configuration Example | Context: Section: Configuration | Context: Starting with Platform 6, the bin installer will no longer copy over the previous properties.json file. To migrate a properties.json file into a new platform.properties file, run this command: | Code: npm run migrate:properties -- --json-file=<path> --out-file=<path> The file generated by this script includes commented out defaults and descriptions for all excluded properties. Itential Platform can be supplied a platform.properties file (or a properties.json ) with the --config-file=<path> launch option. If no --config-file argument is given, Itential Platform will first look in /etc/itential/platform.properties , then the Platform installation directory for a properties.json . If neither file exists, defaults will be used for all configurations not defined by Environment Variables. Profiles are also no longer required for configuration. It is best practice in Platform 6 to use Profiles only for configurations that may change while the server is running, such as prebuiltProps . Additionally, if no configuration for a property exists, Platform 6 will now supply a sensible default value.

Performing a fresh install of Platform 6, which requires you to be aware of the appropriate installation procedures for Adapters and Custom Applications in the new version of the Platform. Before proceeding, here's a few noteworthy differences to be aware of: Alongside the change to RPM for deployment, Itential Platform 6 installs to a different location on-disk than the legacy Platform release versions (22.1/23.1/23.2). For the product to function, it's important to make note of the appropriate location for adapters and custom applications in Platform 6. The installation destination (folder) differs between Platform 6 and the Itential Platform releases (22.1/23.1/23.2). Migration to Platform 6 To migrate, move and copy adapters from your current (legacy) Itential Platform version to the new Platform 6 release: Locate adapters on your current Itential Platform system. Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Locate adapters on your current Itential Platform system. | Code: /opt/itential/pronghorn/node_modules/@ itentialopensource Go into an individual adapter. Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Go into an individual adapter. | Code: cd adapter-name Remove the node_modules directory. Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Remove the node_modules directory. | Code: rm -rf node_modules Remove the package-lock.json . Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Remove the package-lock.json. | Code: rm package-lock.json Change directory out of the adapter. Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Change directory out of the adapter. | Code: cd .. Package and compress the adapter you are working on ( zip , gzip , tar ). Move the compressed adapter to the new Platform 6 system. Change adapter directory to the Platform 6 Services directory. Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Change adapter directory to the Platform 6 Services directory. | Code: /opt/itential/platform/services Decompress the compressed file into the adapter directory. The services directory should contain the individual adapters and not a namespace. Repeat steps 1-9 for all adapters on the current Itential Platform, including any custom adapters that are located in a custom namespace. Follow steps 3 and 4 in the adapter installation section below for each adapter. When you have migrated all of your adapters to Platform 6, follow steps 5-9 of the install below. This is so you will only need to restart the platform once after all adapters have been migrated. Installation To install an adapter: Go to the Itential Platform Services directory: cd /opt/itential/platform/services Clone, unzip, or tar the adapter into your Itential Platform environment. Use one of the methods below: git clone git@gitlab.com:@itentialopensource/adapters/adapter-name unzip adapter-name.zip tar -xvf adapter-name.tar Install the adapter dependencies: cd adapter-name npm install Lint and test the adapter: npm run lint:errors - There should be none. npm run test - All tests should pass. Restart the Itential Platform. Run the following to confirm restart: systemctl restart itential-platform Create an adapter service instance in the Itential Platform Admin Essentials GUI. Configure a service instance configuration for the adapter in the Itential Platform Admin Essentials GUI. Copy the properties from the sampleProperties.json in the adapter directory and place into the inner (second) properties in the Admin Essentials Service Instance Configuration for the adapter. Make all specific changes such as host , port , authentication method, credentials, etc. Set the admin permission role to the adapter for anyone: Building workflows containing an adapter task. Using calls into the adapter for retrieving dynamic data in a JSON form, or within other custom applications. Usage Once the adapter has been installed, configured, and permissions set to the appropriate role, the adapter and its tasks should be available to users of the Itential Platform. Moreover, adapters are flexible with a high degree of customization for a variety of needs and use cases: You can add tasks to a workflow in Automation Studio and then run that workflow. You can add dynamic dropdowns that retrieve the list of data from an adapter. You can integrate the adapter with the Device Broker, which will add devices to Configuration Manager. You can access the adapter methods from your custom applications. You can access the adapter methods through Itential Platform API calls. Limitations & Workarounds A call must exist in the adapter in order to be available. As vendors update APIs, the calls may be missing from adapters. When this occurs, you can use the generic adapter tasks to prevent being blocked while a call is added. Almost all open source adapters come with generic adapter calls that allow you to define endpoints and parameters. These calls can be used when a call is missing from an adapter, or when call parameters have changed. It further allows you to make progress on your use cases while the adapter is being updated to support the additions. Further adapter documentation can be found in the Itential Opensoure library space: Adapters . Logging Adapter debug logs are essential to triage adapter issues. The debug logging that's been enabled includes: OPTIONS, REQUEST and CALL RETURN. [TABLE_0] | Log | Description | |:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | OPTIONS | This logs out most of the information for the call made to the downstream system. | | REQUEST | This logs out the payload for the request to the downstream system. | | CALL RETURN | This is the raw data that the adapter got back from the downstream system. | Testing Once the adapter has been installed: Build and run a workflow with some simple calls. Create a JSON form and add a dynamic dropdown that utilizes an adapter call. For device broker integration: Ensure the system has devices (e.g., Meraki) and there's access to the system. Go to the Admin Essentials GUI to verify broker integration for the adapter through the service instance configuration. Go to Configuration Manager to see if it was able to discover the devices in the down stream system. If not, you may need to confirm the device broker mappings in the adapter. Troubleshooting & Support Typical adapter issues center around configuration and authentication. The adapter sampleProperties should have authentication techniques that were previously used or were documented to work with the adapter. In addition, every open source adapter should have an AUTH.md file that describes the login process and criteria. When using SSL/TLS, you will need to enable SSL in the adapter service instance configuration. This also requires you to provide a ca file or to turn on accept invalid certs . The latter is not recommended for production, but is generally acceptable for development and testing.

Usage Once the adapter has been installed, configured, and permissions set to the appropriate role, the adapter and its tasks should be available to users of the Itential Platform. Moreover, adapters are flexible with a high degree of customization for a variety of needs and use cases: You can add tasks to a workflow in Automation Studio and then run that workflow. You can add dynamic dropdowns that retrieve the list of data from an adapter. You can integrate the adapter with the Device Broker, which will add devices to Configuration Manager. You can access the adapter methods from your custom applications. You can access the adapter methods through Itential Platform API calls. Limitations & Workarounds A call must exist in the adapter in order to be available. As vendors update APIs, the calls may be missing from adapters. When this occurs, you can use the generic adapter tasks to prevent being blocked while a call is added. Almost all open source adapters come with generic adapter calls that allow you to define endpoints and parameters. These calls can be used when a call is missing from an adapter, or when call parameters have changed. It further allows you to make progress on your use cases while the adapter is being updated to support the additions. Further adapter documentation can be found in the Itential Opensoure library space: Adapters . Logging Adapter debug logs are essential to triage adapter issues. The debug logging that's been enabled includes: OPTIONS, REQUEST and CALL RETURN. [TABLE_0] | Log | Description | |:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | OPTIONS | This logs out most of the information for the call made to the downstream system. | | REQUEST | This logs out the payload for the request to the downstream system. | | CALL RETURN | This is the raw data that the adapter got back from the downstream system. | Testing Once the adapter has been installed: Build and run a workflow with some simple calls. Create a JSON form and add a dynamic dropdown that utilizes an adapter call. For device broker integration: Ensure the system has devices (e.g., Meraki) and there's access to the system. Go to the Admin Essentials GUI to verify broker integration for the adapter through the service instance configuration. Go to Configuration Manager to see if it was able to discover the devices in the down stream system. If not, you may need to confirm the device broker mappings in the adapter. Troubleshooting & Support Typical adapter issues center around configuration and authentication. The adapter sampleProperties should have authentication techniques that were previously used or were documented to work with the adapter. In addition, every open source adapter should have an AUTH.md file that describes the login process and criteria. When using SSL/TLS, you will need to enable SSL in the adapter service instance configuration. This also requires you to provide a ca file or to turn on accept invalid certs . The latter is not recommended for production, but is generally acceptable for development and testing.

In order to communicate with these external systems, adapters need to be able to authenticate with the external system. While there are some common ways to authenticate, there is not one way, and systems can undergo changes to the norms (e.g. place the token in a different header). Authentication With External Systems Prior to configuring an adapter to ‚Äútalk‚Äù to an external system, determine the following: Is a username and password required? Is it required on every call or just to retrieve a token? Are you authenticating based on system or user credentials? Do you need to dynamically log in based on different user credentials? Does the system or user associated with the credentials have proper permissions in the system to do what you are trying to do? How often do these credentials change? What are the implications to the adapter when they change? Is a token required to make calls? Are you able to use a static token that has a long or indefinite life? How many steps does it take to acquire a token? If the token expires, how long is the token valid for? If you are requesting a token, what is required (headers, body, etc.)? Is there any additional information that needs to be provided? Do you need to dynamically log in to environments/domains based on some criteria? It is a good practice to authenticate through an API tool, like Postman , because this tool provides information that makes it easier to configure the adapter to communicate with other systems.

This guide provides accessibility information about the Platform user interface (UI) elements along with information about views and controls that are intuitive and scalable. For simplicity, these guidelines are presented herein as UI/UX checklists to verify key accessibility requirements are met in the design and implementation of the Platform. Process and UI Framework Itential has built a set of guidelines to follow when creating user interfaces and designs for the Platform. These guidelines aim at targeting WCAG 2.1 conformance (as recommended by W3C ). Compliance with WCAG 2 is managed primarily through the RodeoUI library, which controls color, font properties, and other visual details. Rodeo is built on Prime React , which claims to be fully accessible and in compliance with Section 508 standards. The Itential Style Guide, Flavor , provides an overview of all UI elements and guidelines for building interfaces with the RodeoUI library. Specific app designs are based on the Flavor style guide and Prime React component library. Informal accessibility audits of live applications are performed pre-release by the Itential Testing & Verification team. Visual Accessibility Accessibility begins with design. The following standards are met by all UI components and patterns in Figma , a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool used at Itential to design and build the Itential Platform. The AA (ideal) level of conformance is the standard for body text compared to background color. For contrast testing, Color Review is used to test compliance. Error, warning, and success states must use icons along with text and color. For colorblind and grayscale testing, the Color Oracle simulator is used. Text style properties (minimum requirements) are: Font size to at least 14px. Text enlargement not to exceed 200% (font magnification, not browser zoom). Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size. Paragraph spacing to at least 2 times the font size. Letter spacing to at least 0.12 times the font size. Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size. Functional Accessibility Every functional test requirement references a WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion target. A project checklist is used to cover most of the WCAG requirements for accessibility and compliance. Accessibility is tested across four major browsers: IE11, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox. Where possible, built-in accessibility checkers are used to inspect a page. For example, in Chrome, select Audit ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Generate Report. If a page is rendered without CSS, it should still be in a logical order and navigable. Keyboard Control (No Mouse) Itential users can use their keyboard like a mouse to navigate and interact with items onscreen. If it can be clicked, selected, or modified (on input) it must be available from the keyboard (tabbing). For drag and drop functionality, a keyboard-based cut and paste alternative can be offered, or a separate UI for accessibility can be enabled. No keyboard traps. User must always be able to leave a component with the keyboard. Tabbing must be in a logical top-down, left-right order. A tab-index is used to enforce a certain tabbing order, where needed. If a button or link triggers a dialog or modal window, when the user closes the dialog, they should not be forced back to the top of the page. The element that had focus when the dialog was launched should regain focus when the dialog is closed. Keyboard arrows do not trigger an event or function. Elements with focus have clear visible focus indication. When an element receives focus, no unexpected action is triggered. Selecting or changing a checkbox, radio button, or toggle does not trigger unexpected changes in page context or content. The table below presents a list of keyboard shortcuts and best practices for assistive technologies and accessibility. [TABLE_0] | Press this | To do this | |:----------------|:----------------------------------------| | Enter | Click to action | | Spacebar | Toggle Choose an item Open a dropdown | | Tab | Navigate in a logical pattern | | Keyboard Arrows | Navigate inside a dropdown or container | Screen Reader Screen reader is the interface that specifically works within browsers to read content aloud for blind and low vision individuals. Gives ability for user to pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or auto-updating content. Does not use color as a visual means to convey information - must use icon and text. All Form elements have labels, and labels use the <label-for> html attribute to link a label to an input. Offers a \"skip to main content\" button on UIs for screen readers to offer the user a chance to bypass headers and navigation elements that are repeated on every page. The <label-for> html attribute to link a label to an input can be hidden using CSS so it is only visible to the screen reader, but Do Not Use visibility:hidden or display:none to hide the link. Each page has a title clearly describing the topic or purpose of that page. The <title> tag in a page header is compliant, and shows page topic in a Browser Tab. Links and buttons that do not have clear text have a title attribute that conveys purpose or target. All symbols and images have alternative text. All images have a descriptive alt attribute, or an empty string ( alt=\"\" ) if it is a purely decorative image. Page language is specified in HTML markup. Validation uses clear and explicit language for input errors. Required inputs use a proper attribute. Sections have status roles using the <role=\"\"> attribute ARIA is used, where appropriate, to better identify the purpose of UI elements. Tables have header cells describing either the column that comes below it, or the row that comes after it. As a result, table cells are properly marked with a ‚Äúscope‚Äù attribute so that the screen reader knows how to match the heading to the data. React Specifications In React, the for attribute is written as htmlFor in JSX. Sometimes HTML semantics is broken when adding <div> elements to JSX to make React code work, especially when working with lists ( <ol> , <ul> and <dl> ) and the HTML <table> .

Multiple automated tests are run prior to code merges alongside testing that is executed regularly on a daily and monthly basis. This guide provides an overview of the types of testing that Itential performs, ranging from specific unit tests to overall system and integration testing. Additionally, it gives recommendations for users of the platform as a way of a reminder to ensure their deployments are stable and deployed without incident. Test Coverage Test coverage for Itential Platform and IAG is executed via daily automated tests (over 4K tests within 50 repositories) as well as during the delivery of both maintenance and feature releases. This is accomplished using open-source industry standard tools. Types of Testing Our product testing includes: Unit testing by developers within their assigned teams. This is a combination of light automated testing and manual testing. HTTP API testing (automated) using Mocha and Chai against a real Itential Platform server. User interface (UI) and end-to-end (E2E) component testing (automated) using Cypress . Python testing with Pytest for IAG and other Python components. Test Releases There are two types of test releases at Itential: Maintenance and Feature. Maintenance - This release is targeted to deliver fixes related to bugs and security the first Wednesday of each month. SDETs (Software Developers Engineer in Test) begin testing for this type of release within two weeks before delivery. Feature - This release is targeted for delivery of the next version of Itential Platform and Itential Automation Gateway (IAG). The intent is to provide one to two Platform feature releases within a year. IAG is released more frequently and typically delivers three to four releases within the year. SDETs (Software Developers Engineer in Test) begin testing for this type of release within 30 to 40 days. Test Recommendations Itential recommends the following test practices for any customized solution (i.e., workflows, JSTs, forms, etc) that utilizes IAP/IAG. Have a dedicated staging lab where there are real instances of network devices and services, and always test in the staging lab first. Do not just test workflows, but test all components. Also test the JSON forms that are built because JSON forms can dynamically pull server-side data, which means full integration testing of JSON forms in a staging lab. Automated Test Recommendations For automated testing, Itential customers should follow these key practices. Use Cypress. There are equally valid alternatives; however, Cypress is the de facto recommendation since it is utilized by Itential for UI testing. Use mock adapter data as prescribed by this Itential resource: adapters/mock-data Use API testing on your workflows as follows: startJob to start workflows getJobDetails in a loop until there are manual tasks to work completeJob to proceed with the workflow Make assertions on the job exit status or the task output. Use Cypress E2E testing to assert if other components (e.g., JSON Forms, Command Templates, etc) work. Post-Upgrade Recommendations Itential customers should always test their software instance after every Platform or IAG upgrade. Although Itential runs test workflows through an automated test suite prior to each feature release or scheduled maintenance release, our workflows are invariably different than a customer's specific workflows. Itential also cannot fully scale its test environment to emulate every exact customer environment. Therefore, it is prudent to always test if specific components and solutions still work post-upgrade. Moreover, Itential highly recommends an in-depth review of Release Notes , Deprecation Notices , and Breaking Changes for each release. Changes between release versions of the Itential software may require you to make changes to your application in order to avoid disruption to your system's implementation, and a critical analysis for any potential impact will best direct your testing efforts for any necessary modifications.

Use mock adapter data as prescribed by this Itential resource: adapters/mock-data Use API testing on your workflows as follows: startJob to start workflows getJobDetails in a loop until there are manual tasks to work completeJob to proceed with the workflow Make assertions on the job exit status or the task output. Use Cypress E2E testing to assert if other components (e.g., JSON Forms, Command Templates, etc) work. Post-Upgrade Recommendations Itential customers should always test their software instance after every Platform or IAG upgrade. Although Itential runs test workflows through an automated test suite prior to each feature release or scheduled maintenance release, our workflows are invariably different than a customer's specific workflows. Itential also cannot fully scale its test environment to emulate every exact customer environment. Therefore, it is prudent to always test if specific components and solutions still work post-upgrade. Moreover, Itential highly recommends an in-depth review of Release Notes , Deprecation Notices , and Breaking Changes for each release. Changes between release versions of the Itential software may require you to make changes to your application in order to avoid disruption to your system's implementation, and a critical analysis for any potential impact will best direct your testing efforts for any necessary modifications.

Itential recommends using the latest adapter version available in the Itential marketplace in parallel with the deprecated adapter and converting your workflows to use the new adapter before the old adapter is incompatible.\n| Deprecation       | Replacement                      | Deprecation Date   | Archive Date   |\n|:------------------|:---------------------------------|:-------------------|:---------------|\n| adapter-batfish   | nan                              | 07-15-2024         | 07-15-2025     |\n| adapter-kafka     | adapter-kafkav2                  | 09-01-2024         | 09-01-2025     |\n| adapter-netrounds | adapter-paragon_active_assurance | 01-15-2024         | 01-15-2025     |\n| adapter-velocloud | adapter-velocloud_orchestrator   | 01-15-2024         | 01-15-2025     |\n", "links": [["https://docs.itential.com/opensource/docs/overview-library-adapt", 5.0, "Prev"], ["https://docs.itential.com/opensource/docs/gitlab-file-definitions-adapters", 5.0, "Next"]], "timestamp": 1755318434.112827, "content_type": "technical_requirements", "priority_score": 6.0, "is_critical": false, "found_keywords": ["node"], "has_tables": true, "has_code_blocks": false, "has_config_examples": false, "has_dependencies": true}

Itential Platform 2022.1.0 In this feature release of the Itential Platform, you will see: Improved Golden Configuration importing functionality to support overwrites and renaming duplicates. This enhancement allows users to easily migrate Golden Configurations between environments such as from development to production. Incorporated a new DiffViewer to handle large configurations. Previously, the config diff functionality would timeout on extremely large device configurations. It now works in a very timely manner. Implemented the ability to update (patch) device variables without replacing all existing variables. Added new icons to the main IAG UI sidebar for each of the sliding menus. Bolstered support to write the IAG global log to the file system. Fixed Auto-Work mode to better handle jobs and tasks under certain network conditions. Applied a new Gen 2 canvas component to display Gen 2 jobs. Updated the JST application in Automation Studio to use React to enhance the user experience for integrating JSTs. Added new functionality to the JST Builder to allow for if..else statements as well as switch statements. Fixed the Command and Analytic Template collections to better handle incoming schema objects that are broken or not fully compatible. Improved handling of workflows with special characters so they no longer fail on import. Refined the transformation check to ensure an error is displayed when something goes wrong while rendering a transformation. Incorporated a more unique server ID for better identification, security, and ease of use. Provided the ability to auto-write passwords to Vault when entered through Admin Essentials. This feature will also mask those passwords from view within the UI. With this feature addition, Itential users have the option to use their own HashiCorp Vault Secrets Manager in a ‚Äòread-only‚Äô mode. Made integration improvements with AWS Lambda. Improved the API caching mechanisms for a better UI experience. Boosted recovery efforts when processes die by allowing the platform to restart the service. Accelerated the processing performance for large task objects from 2 minutes to 3 seconds. Improved log messaging to assist with troubleshooting run failures and other problem scenarios. Modified the platform UI infrastructure to improve quality and enable auto-testing in future releases.

Itential Platform Core Updates Active User Visibility - When assigned the correct permissions, this feature will allow administrators to see users who currently have an active login session and optionally log them out. BullMQ Support ‚Äì Itential Platform 2023.2 introduces BullMQ Support, which is a messaging service designed to give a more seamless experience during Itential Platform deployment. Built on top of Redis, it will replace RabbitMQ, reducing the number of dependencies administrators will need to install and manage as part of an IAP deployment. MongoDB Performance Enhancement ‚Äì Itential Platform 2023.2 enables users to exceed the 16MB limit for files stored in MongoDB through GridFS for applications executing workflows in workflow engine. A part of Mongo, GridFS automatically breaks large files into individual pieces, storing them separately and improving platform performance. SAML SSO Support - The 2023.2 feature release now provides customers the ability to authenticate to Itential Platform using SAML SSO. This feature will allow users to authenticate once in their preferred identify management platform, such as Okta or Microsoft, and then connect to the Itential Platform using their SSO credentials. Automation Studio Projects - Projects is a container-like environment where designers can collaborate to create workflows, forms, templates, and JSTs as an entire use case, rather than as individual assets within Automation Studio (\"Studio\"). The assets within the Project will appear in one list and are not separated by type, but instead, are distinguishable by icons. Canvas Enhancements ‚Äì Itential Platform 2023.2 provides canvas search, which gives users the ability to find and highlight tasks on the canvas, allowing them to quickly locate specific items and tasks. This release also includes reference management, which allows users to visualize the path of incoming and outgoing data. Lifecycle Manager Model & Instance Enhancements ‚Äì Itential Platform 2023.2 now enables users to import and export Lifecycle Manager instances between environments. This feature also allows administrators to take periodic backups of instances. Configuration Manager / Operations Manager Compliance for JSON & CLI Arrays - Users can now set rules to specify required components or to specify what order configuration rules must be in. These enhancements add the ability to enforce the management of arrays. Compliance Reporting - Compliance Reporting can now be created and run as an automation, giving you the flexibility to schedule and trigger a compliance check. These automations allow you to group various Golden Configuration compliance checks into a single running effort.

Only the admin user will be able to configure these service types. For example, if an admin would like to prevent all users of the system from modifying the AAA adapter then they can do so by specifying \"LDAP\" (if LDAP is the configured AAA system) within the servicesBlacklist property. Remember the values in the servicesBlacklist property are the service type. To find this value, navigate to the service config (e.g. Adapter Configuration) and look for the \"properties\" array and the \"type\" value for the targeted service. Use the value of \"type\" and remember that all adapters of this type will be restricted; in other words, it restricts by type and not by instance. |\n| shutdownTimeout                      | Number  | 3         | The time (seconds) Itential Platform waits before it shuts down its services. This allows a service to have some time to perform any operations it may need to do before it exits. This timeout also applies to the service life-cycle actions \"stop\", \"restart\", and \"crashes\". If a service completes its cleanup operations before the timeout, it will exit. During a system wide shutdown, all services will stay active until every service has completed their cleanup operations. If operations are completed before the timeout, the platform will exit. If for some reason a service is unable to complete its cleanup operations within the specified shutdown timeout, it will be forcibly closed and a message written to the logs indicating the name of the service that incurred the timeout, and then the platform will exit.                                                                                                                             |\nSample System Properties Below is a sample systemProps configuration when used with the Advanced Mode editor.\n\nTable: uiProps ÔÅö This profile property applies to legacy versions of Itential Platform (2023.2 and earlier).

Testing the Template Builder Security Configuration To test the Template Builder security configuration: Ensure Itential Platform is running. Examine the logs. Template Builder will report that it is creating a sandbox directory for Jinja2 template execution, and when it is finished, it will report either the success or failure of the process. On the first run of the server, this will likely take several minutes, and Template Builder will report back to API requests that it is still initializing until it is finished. Once Template Builder has finished initializing the sandbox directory, run a Jinja2 template.

Performing a fresh install of Platform 6, which requires you to be aware of the appropriate installation procedures for Adapters and Custom Applications in the new version of the Platform. Before proceeding, here's a few noteworthy differences to be aware of: Alongside the change to RPM for deployment, Itential Platform 6 installs to a different location on-disk than the legacy Platform release versions (22.1/23.1/23.2). For the product to function, it's important to make note of the appropriate location for adapters and custom applications in Platform 6. The installation destination (folder) differs between Platform 6 and the Itential Platform releases (22.1/23.1/23.2). Migration to Platform 6 To migrate, move and copy adapters from your current (legacy) Itential Platform version to the new Platform 6 release: Locate adapters on your current Itential Platform system. Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Locate adapters on your current Itential Platform system. | Code: /opt/itential/pronghorn/node_modules/@ itentialopensource Go into an individual adapter. Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Go into an individual adapter. | Code: cd adapter-name Remove the node_modules directory. Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Remove the node_modules directory. | Code: rm -rf node_modules Remove the package-lock.json . Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Remove the package-lock.json. | Code: rm package-lock.json Change directory out of the adapter. Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Change directory out of the adapter. | Code: cd .. Package and compress the adapter you are working on ( zip , gzip , tar ). Move the compressed adapter to the new Platform 6 system. Change adapter directory to the Platform 6 Services directory. Code Block Example | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Change adapter directory to the Platform 6 Services directory. | Code: /opt/itential/platform/services Decompress the compressed file into the adapter directory. The services directory should contain the individual adapters and not a namespace. Repeat steps 1-9 for all adapters on the current Itential Platform, including any custom adapters that are located in a custom namespace. Follow steps 3 and 4 in the adapter installation section below for each adapter. When you have migrated all of your adapters to Platform 6, follow steps 5-9 of the install below. This is so you will only need to restart the platform once after all adapters have been migrated. Installation To install an adapter: Go to the Itential Platform Services directory: cd /opt/itential/platform/services Clone, unzip, or tar the adapter into your Itential Platform environment. Use one of the methods below: git clone git@gitlab.com:@itentialopensource/adapters/adapter-name unzip adapter-name.zip tar -xvf adapter-name.tar Install the adapter dependencies: cd adapter-name npm install Lint and test the adapter: npm run lint:errors - There should be none. npm run test - All tests should pass. Restart the Itential Platform. Run the following to confirm restart: systemctl restart itential-platform Create an adapter service instance in the Itential Platform Admin Essentials GUI. Configure a service instance configuration for the adapter in the Itential Platform Admin Essentials GUI. Copy the properties from the sampleProperties.json in the adapter directory and place into the inner (second) properties in the Admin Essentials Service Instance Configuration for the adapter. Make all specific changes such as host , port , authentication method, credentials, etc. Set the admin permission role to the adapter for anyone: Building workflows containing an adapter task. Using calls into the adapter for retrieving dynamic data in a JSON form, or within other custom applications. Usage Once the adapter has been installed, configured, and permissions set to the appropriate role, the adapter and its tasks should be available to users of the Itential Platform. Moreover, adapters are flexible with a high degree of customization for a variety of needs and use cases: You can add tasks to a workflow in Automation Studio and then run that workflow. You can add dynamic dropdowns that retrieve the list of data from an adapter. You can integrate the adapter with the Device Broker, which will add devices to Configuration Manager. You can access the adapter methods from your custom applications. You can access the adapter methods through Itential Platform API calls. Limitations & Workarounds A call must exist in the adapter in order to be available. As vendors update APIs, the calls may be missing from adapters. When this occurs, you can use the generic adapter tasks to prevent being blocked while a call is added. Almost all open source adapters come with generic adapter calls that allow you to define endpoints and parameters. These calls can be used when a call is missing from an adapter, or when call parameters have changed. It further allows you to make progress on your use cases while the adapter is being updated to support the additions. Further adapter documentation can be found in the Itential Opensoure library space: Adapters . Logging Adapter debug logs are essential to triage adapter issues. The debug logging that's been enabled includes: OPTIONS, REQUEST and CALL RETURN. [TABLE_0] | Log | Description | |:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | OPTIONS | This logs out most of the information for the call made to the downstream system. | | REQUEST | This logs out the payload for the request to the downstream system. | | CALL RETURN | This is the raw data that the adapter got back from the downstream system. | Testing Once the adapter has been installed: Build and run a workflow with some simple calls. Create a JSON form and add a dynamic dropdown that utilizes an adapter call. For device broker integration: Ensure the system has devices (e.g., Meraki) and there's access to the system. Go to the Admin Essentials GUI to verify broker integration for the adapter through the service instance configuration. Go to Configuration Manager to see if it was able to discover the devices in the down stream system. If not, you may need to confirm the device broker mappings in the adapter. Troubleshooting & Support Typical adapter issues center around configuration and authentication. The adapter sampleProperties should have authentication techniques that were previously used or were documented to work with the adapter. In addition, every open source adapter should have an AUTH.md file that describes the login process and criteria. When using SSL/TLS, you will need to enable SSL in the adapter service instance configuration. This also requires you to provide a ca file or to turn on accept invalid certs . The latter is not recommended for production, but is generally acceptable for development and testing.

Fixed issues with multi-select dropdowns that use a large dataset.                                                                                                   |\n| ENG-7205  | OpenAPI Integration Models can be imported, but when creating an instance or starting the server with a created instance, an error occurred within Admin Essentials. Updated the swagger-client to ensure support of OpenAPI 3.1 integrations.                                                           |\n| ENG-7848  | Retrieving devices with the getDevicesFiltered API call did not return results as expected via Config Manager and Automation Gateway tasks.

A fix has been pushed to not allow users with view access to move these assets.                                                                              |\n| ENG-8045  | When adding a function in JST Designer, the name may unexpectedly add a \"(1)\". Updated logic to check for id and name collisons to fix a case where adding a function to a JST would unnecessarily rename the function.                                                                                  |\n| ENG-8354  | When Itential Platform is running with no active profile, an error message displays when the user tries to create, update, or delete a repository configuration in Admin Essentials.

Implemented a tree view in the References Panel that allows users to search for references ad-hoc.                                                                                                                                    |\n| ENG-9018  | In a JSON Form with a table that has a custom key, adding a form element to the table and then changing the custom key no longer removes the added element.                                                                                                                                              |\n| ENG-9031  | API errors as a result of cloning a Command Template and Analytic Template no longer crash the UI. Also updated the JSON schema for Command Templates and Analytic Templates to allow for the createdBy and lastUpdatedBy fields to be null.                                                             |\n| ENG-9222  | Removed request queue for integration tasks to prevent CPU increase when worker threads are unavailable. Added logs to improve debugging for integration tasks.                                                                                                                                          |\n| ENG-9268  | When collapsing a schema in JST Designer, any nested assignments disappear which allows users to create invalid duplicate assignments. Fixed the schema collapse issue to ensure assignments persist and prevent invalid assignments.                                                                    |\n| ENG-9305  | When attempting to duplicate or import a project in Automation Studio, workflows disappear from the duplicated or imported project. Updated the schema logic to resolve issue. Workflows, templates, transformations and JSON forms should now appear correctly when duplicating or importing a project. |\n| ENG-9419  | In some scenarios, the Platform would not correctly handle changes in Redis Sentinel cluster topology. Added behavior to correctly reconnect when Redis Sentinel cluster topology changes.                                                                                                               |\n| ENG-9478  | Added ancestor-checking in the cancel jobs endpoint to only cancel the greatest ancestor within a batch, and removing any unnecessary compute without affecting cancellation results. This also mitigates the likelihood of runaway recursive looping into high memory usage.                            |\n| ENG-9668  | Removed skipNormalization flag on resolve of integration swagger docs to ensure Itential Platform methods include path level and operation level parameters, while ensuring any method operationId with special characters are not replaced.                                                             |\n| ENG-9754  | When trying to clear a trigger type in Operations (Ops) Manager to select a different trigger type, the application UI would stop working. Fixed a bug in the createTrigger API that caused Ops Manager to crash when clearing out initial trigger data.                                                 |\n| ENG-9878  | Renaming a Command or Analytic Template in Projects to a duplicate name correctly displays the error in Projects and no longer crashes the MOP service.                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ENG-10179 | Added a type check to the JSON form dropdown to confirm source items are valid and prevent search issues in the Render JSON Schema task.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ENG-10185 | Added a missing property key to resolve a \"React Missing Array Key\" security rule warning.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\nImprovements This section highlights quality improvements to Itential Platform's functionality in this maintenance release.\n\nTable: This maintenance release of Itential Platform includes fixes for bugs that were reported to Itential Product Support.

Testing the Template Builder Security Configuration To test the Template Builder security configuration: Ensure Itential Platform is running. Examine the logs. Template Builder will report that it is creating a sandbox directory for Jinja2 template execution, and when it is finished, it will report either the success or failure of the process. On the first run of the server, this will likely take several minutes, and Template Builder will report back to API requests that it is still initializing until it is finished. Once Template Builder has finished initializing the sandbox directory, run a Jinja2 template.

If file permissions prevent Template Builder from copying these files into its chroot jail directory, Python will not be able to execute within the sandbox subshell and Template Builder will fall back to executing in insecure mode. Testing the Template Builder Security Configuration To test the Template Builder security configuration: Ensure Itential Platform is running. Examine the logs. Template Builder will report that it is creating a sandbox directory for Jinja2 template execution, and when it is finished, it will report either the success or failure of the process. On the first run of the server, this will likely take several minutes, and Template Builder will report back to API requests that it is still initializing until it is finished. Once Template Builder has finished initializing the sandbox directory, run a Jinja2 template. Examine the server logs and look to make sure there are no warnings stating that Jinja2 execution is running in insecure mode. Was this article helpful?

This guide will provide several strategies to improve query performance, including proper indexes, TTL indexes, and pruning strategies using scripts. Query Performance To decide whether data should be pruned, query performance should be analyzed to check for proper indexes. Explain plans can be run to indicate the use of indexes on a specific query. For more information, see the Mongo tutorial on analyzing query performance using explain plans . Indexes are data structures that MongoDB uses for more efficient queries. If running explain plans on a query reveals the need for an index, it should be created. For more information, see the MongoDB manual on indexes . A proper indexing strategy takes priority over data pruning for improving query performance. If a collection has all the necessary indexes and query performance is still slow, then other strategies should be employed. TTL Index If documents in a collection are not needed after a certain amount of time, a TTL index can be used to automatically remove documents after a specified number of seconds or at an exact time. TTL indexes can only be created on fields with a date value or array of date values. It is not recommended that TTL indexes are used as a primary means for query performance improvements, but should be considered only if it is certain that the data (in a collection) needs to persist for a specific amount of time. For more information, see the MongoDB manual on TTL indexes . Capped Collections If a collection is capped, a limit can be specified on the number of documents or amount of data that can be stored in the collection. Capped collections employ a first-in-first-out strategy, which means that if a document insertion pushes the collection past its maximum constraints, the oldest inserted document is removed. Note that collections can only be capped on creation. Capped collections should only be created if a specific amount of the most recently inserted data is needed. For more information, see the MongoDB manual on capped collections . Archival Strategy If query performance is not sufficient given proper indexes on data that should persist for historical records, an archival strategy can be employed to reduce the amount of data in a collection. This can involve a process that moves a subset of a collection's documents to another collection, database, or other means of persistence. Documents can also be deleted if they no longer need to persist. The specific archival strategy that is used depends on the use case and performance needs. Archival Strategy Example for Job Metrics Beginning with 2021.1, a dashboard was added to Operations Manager that displays metrics on jobs run in Itential Platform. This dashboard runs queries against the wfe_job_metrics collection. Since only one document is inserted per automation, it is rare for the collection to grow large enough to highly impact query performance; however, search performance can degrade if that number becomes high enough over time. In that scenario, it may be necessary to create a script that archives or removes metrics on all jobs completed before a certain date, which could improve query performance. Additionally, job metrics for automations that had no jobs completed in a recent timeframe can be archived. In this example, the importance of query performance should be weighed against the need for the subset of data being archived in the dashbaord. Was this article helpful?

Compliance with organizational security and regulatory requirements. Configuring PingID SAML SSO in the Itential Platform Beginning with the 2023.2 release, access management in the Itential Platform was expanded to include SAML SSO Authentication . Itential also supports PingID as an Identity Provider (IdP). This article explains how to set up a SAML SSO between Itential Platform and PingID. Prerequisites Itential assumes the reader has completed the process of setting up SAML SSO Authentication in Itential Platform via Admin Essentials, and has mapped their Identity Provider (Itential Platform ‚Üí Admin Essentials ‚Üí Authorization ‚Üí Identity Providers). Please keep in mind that each organization may have their PingID system configured differently and this guide is not all-inclusive of every system environment. A basic guide to configuring PingID as a SAML Identity Provider (IdP) is available on the Ping Identity site: Configuring a SAML Application A short demo of how to setup PingID and a \"test application\" to work with SAML SSO is shown in this resource video: Adding PingID Attributes When configuring an Identity Provider (\"IdP\") in the Itential Platform , you will need to enter an Entity ID (called the \"Issuer\") that identifies the identity provider. Sign in to PingID and go to the Itential Platform application that was setup under Applications . Under SAML Configuration copy the Entity ID (Figure 1). This will be used to satisfy the Issuer parameter . Sign in to Itential Platform and navigate to the Identity Providers Configuration tab (Admin Essentials ‚Üí Authorization ‚Üí Identity Providers ‚Üí Configuration). Paste the Entity ID into the Issuer field (Figure 2). Figure 1: PingId Entity ID Figure 2: Itential Platform IdP Issuer Field In the PingID administrative console, go to the Applications ‚Üí Configuration tab and copy the Single Signon Service key (Figure 3). This will be used to satisfy the Login URL parameter on the Itential Platform Identity Providers ‚Üí Configuration form (Figure 4). Download the Signing Certificate file from the PingID administrative console (Applications ‚Üí Configuration tab) and then upload the certificate file to the Identity Providers ‚Üí Configuration form by drag-and-drop, or use the Click to Browse link to find and select the file to upload (Figure 4). Figure 3: PingID Single Signon Service Key & Signing Certificate Figure 4: Itential Platform IdP Login URL & Certificate Upload In the PingID administrative console, go to the Applications ‚Üí Attribute Mappings tab and copy the Username, Group Names, and Email Addresses under the PingOne column (Figure 5). In Itential Platform , on the Identity Providers ‚Üí Configuration tab, paste the PingID: Username in the Username Attribute field Group Names in the Groups Attribute field Email Addresses in the Email Attribute field Figure 5: PingID Attribute Mappings Figure 6: Itential Platform IdP Attribute Fields Click the Save button at the top of the Identity Providers page (next to Test Connection) to retain all your inputs (Figure 6). Testing the PingID Configuration To enable PingID in Itential Platform, you will need to test the config. You can initiate testing by clicking the Test Connection button at the top of the Identity Providers page (under the Configuration tab name). This will initiate SSO SAML authentication with PingID in a new tab and a message will display to indicate if testing is successful or not. If the message indicates a successful test connection, then all parameters are set correctly and you can close the tab. With a successful test connection, you should have Groups showing from the Authentication Server that you can map to Itential Platform. You will want to map at least the pronghorn admin group to give permissions within Itential Platform. Figure 7: Successful Test Message If you receive an unsuccessful message, there might be a problem with the parameters or certificate that was provided. Check your configured SAML settings to verify all attributes are mapped correctly. Figure 8: Unsuccessful Test Message Enabling PingID SSO Lastly, you will need to enable PingID SAML to direct users to use SSO to login. The PingID IdP is disabled by default. Navigate to the Identity Providers list view (Itential Platform ‚Üí Admin Essentials ‚Üí Authorization ‚Üí Identity Providers). Locate the IdP (PingID) and slide the toggle switch to activate as Enabled . Once PingID is enabled, the Itential Platform authentication method immediately switches to SSO SAML.

This version brings many exciting improvements to the Itential Platform and IAG, but also removes some deprecated features. Visit the Deprecations guide to see what is scheduled for removal in 2023.1, and be sure to check out Itential's showcase video and media resources . Itential Platform Itential added new features and made significant improvements to Itential Platform with the 2023.1 release. Some of the feature highlights include: ‚Ä¢ Packaged Itential Platform as a container image to simplify deployment and configuration by a broad range of container management tools. ‚Ä¢ Enabled Service Accounts to support northbound access to Itential Platform and provide OAuth2 client credential support for external apps to connect to Itential Platform. ‚Ä¢ Integrations can now authorize themselves to 3rd party applications using OAuth2 grant flows. ‚Ä¢ Itential Platform‚Äôs Swagger document is now available as a fully compliant OpenAPI 3.1 document. Users have a ‚Äútry it out‚Äù feature to directly test Itential Platform APIs using their login session credentials. ‚Ä¢ Itential Platform core changes have been made to further simplify deploying blue-green architectures. ‚Ä¢ Certification for Itential Platform 2023.1 to run on Red Hat 8, Red Hat 9, Rocky 8 and Rocky 9 operating systems. Admin Essentials Admin Essentials is now a UI-only application. As such, it no longer has a corresponding service configuration. If you see a service configuration for ‚ÄúAdminEssentials‚Äù (Itential Platform ‚Üí Admin Essentials ‚Üí Applications), you most likely have an improper installation. Please ensure the migration scripts were run properly during the upgrade process.

Overview A distributed execution cluster consists of: Shared database (etcd or DynamoDB) : Stores cluster data and coordinates communication between gateway servers Gateway server(s) : Manages automation resources and delegates execution to runners Runner nodes : Execute automation services and report results back to gateway server(s) Gateway client : Sends requests to the gateway server for processing Prerequisites Before starting the deployment: Ensure all nodes have IAG installed Verify network connectivity between all components Have administrative access to configure each component Understand your desired cluster topology and node assignments Step 1: Configure the shared database Choose between etcd or Amazon DynamoDB based on your infrastructure preferences and requirements. Both databases store cluster data and enable coordination between cluster nodes. Option A: Configure etcd database The etcd database stores data in a persistent key-value store and enables coordination between cluster nodes. Setup etcd Install and configure etcd following the official etcd documentation Configure etcd server or cluster using the etcd database configuration procedures Verify etcd is running and accessible from all planned gateway cluster nodes Record connection details (hostname and port) for use in subsequent configuration steps Security Considerations Configure appropriate authentication and authorization for etcd access Ensure network security between etcd and gateway cluster nodes Consider TLS encryption for etcd communications in production environments Option B: Configure Amazon DynamoDB table Amazon DynamoDB provides a managed NoSQL database service that can serve as the shared database for gateway clusters. Setup DynamoDB Create a DynamoDB table following the DynamoDB table configuration procedures Configure AWS credentials with appropriate permissions for all gateway cluster nodes Verify connectivity from all planned gateway cluster nodes to AWS DynamoDB service Record AWS region and table configuration for use in subsequent configuration steps Security Considerations Configure IAM roles and policies with least privilege access Enable encryption at rest and in transit Consider VPC endpoints for enhanced security Monitor access through AWS CloudTrail Step 2: Configure the gateway server The gateway server manages automation resources and coordinates execution across runner nodes. Database Connection Configuration Choose the appropriate configuration based on your selected database option. For etcd database Set the etcd connection : Configure GATEWAY_STORE_ETCD_HOSTS to the hostname:port of your etcd server For etcd clusters, use a space-separated list: hostname1:port hostname2:port hostname3:port Verify etcd store variables : Review all GATEWAY_STORE_ETCD_* configuration variables Ensure they match your etcd setup and security requirements For more information, see Store variables . Handle data migration (if applicable): If migrating from a local database to etcd, use the iagctl db migrate command For more information, see iagctl db migrate Plan migration during a maintenance window to avoid service disruption For DynamoDB database Set the DynamoDB connection : Configure GATEWAY_STORE_DYNAMODB_* variables according to your AWS setup Set the appropriate AWS region and table names Configure AWS credentials through environment variables, IAM roles, or credential files Verify DynamoDB store variables : Review all GATEWAY_STORE_DYNAMODB_* configuration variables Ensure proper AWS permissions and connectivity For more information, see Store variables . Handle data migration (if applicable): If migrating from a local database to DynamoDB, use the iagctl db migrate command For more information, iagctl db migrate Plan migration during a maintenance window to avoid service disruption Cluster Configuration Set the cluster ID : Configure GATEWAY_APPLICATION_CLUSTER_ID to your desired cluster identifier Use a descriptive name that reflects the cluster's purpose or environment Note: Changing the cluster ID creates a new namespace in the database Configure application mode : Set GATEWAY_APPLICATION_MODE to server This designates the node as a gateway server rather than a runner Distributed Execution Setup Enable distributed execution : Set GATEWAY_SERVER_DISTRIBUTED_EXECUTION to true This enables round-robin distribution of execution requests to registered runners Runners must share the same database (etcd or DynamoDB) and cluster ID Configure server variables : Verify all GATEWAY_SERVER_* configuration variables are properly set Ensure configuration allows gateway clients to connect and send requests Pay particular attention to network and security settings Start the gateway server Launch the gateway server : Start the server using one of the following methods: Use the systemd service (if installed via installer): systemctl start iagctl Run directly from the CLI (if installed without a service): iagctl server Start your container (if using containerized deployment) The server will begin listening for requests from configured gateway clients Monitor logs for successful startup and database connection confirmation Step 3: Configure runner nodes Runner nodes handle the actual execution of automation services delegated by gateway servers. Database and Cluster Configuration Configure database connection : Set all database configuration variables to match the gateway server exactly For etcd: Use identical GATEWAY_STORE_ETCD_* values For DynamoDB: Use identical GATEWAY_STORE_DYNAMODB_* values Use identical values to ensure proper cluster membership Set cluster membership : Configure GATEWAY_APPLICATION_CLUSTER_ID to the same value as the gateway server This ensures the runner joins the correct cluster namespace Set application mode : Configure GATEWAY_APPLICATION_MODE to runner This designates the node as an execution-only runner Runner Communication Setup Configure runner variables : Set appropriate values for all GATEWAY_RUNNER_* configuration variables Ensure runner nodes can communicate with the gateway server Configure any specific execution environment requirements Start Runner Nodes Launch each runner : Start each runner using one of the following methods: Use the systemd service (if installed via installer): systemctl start iagctl Run directly from the CLI (if installed without a service): iagctl runner Start your container (if using containerized deployment) Monitor logs for successful startup Look for the INFO level log message: registered runner with database This confirms successful registration with the cluster Step 4: Configure gateway client The gateway client sends automation requests to the gateway server for processing and execution. Client Connection Setup Configure server connection : Set GATEWAY_CLIENT_HOST to the hostname or IP address of the gateway server Set GATEWAY_CLIENT_PORT to the port of the gateway server Ensure the hostname is resolvable and accessible from the client Verify client configuration : Review all GATEWAY_CLIENT_* configuration variables Ensure proper network connectivity and authentication settings Configure any required security parameters Client Authentication Authenticate with the server : Follow the login guide to authenticate the client Verify successful authentication before proceeding Ensure client has appropriate permissions for intended operations Step 5: Verify cluster deployment Test Cluster Connectivity Check runner registration : Run iagctl get runners from the gateway client Verify all expected runners appear in the output Confirm runners show as online and available Verify cluster status : Check that all runners are registered with the same cluster ID Confirm gateway server recognizes all runners Review logs for any connectivity issues Test Service Execution Execute test services : Run automation requests through the gateway client Monitor execution across different runner nodes Verify round-robin distribution is working correctly Monitor execution logs : Observe logs on runner nodes during service execution Confirm services execute on the expected runner nodes Verify results are returned correctly to the client Performance Verification Test load distribution : Execute multiple concurrent requests Verify load is distributed across available runners Monitor resource utilization on runner nodes Validate failover behavior : Temporarily disable a runner node Confirm execution continues on remaining runners Verify automatic redistribution of load Troubleshooting Common Issues Runners Not Registering Check database connectivity : Verify all nodes can connect to the shared database (etcd or DynamoDB) Verify cluster ID : Ensure all nodes use the same GATEWAY_APPLICATION_CLUSTER_ID Review network configuration : Check firewall rules and network connectivity For DynamoDB : Verify AWS credentials and IAM permissions Examine logs : Look for specific error messages in runner startup logs Gateway Server Not Recognizing Runners Verify database configuration : Ensure gateway server and runners use identical database settings *** Check distributed execution**: Confirm GATEWAY_SERVER_DISTRIBUTED_EXECUTION is set to true Review cluster membership : Verify cluster ID consistency across all nodes For DynamoDB : Ensure consistent AWS region and table configuration Client Connection Issues Verify server accessibility : Confirm client can reach gateway server hostname/IP Check authentication : Ensure client authentication is properly configured Review network settings : Verify firewall rules allow client-server communication Review TLS configuration : Confirm TLS configuration from client to server Post-Deployment Tasks Monitoring Setup Implement cluster monitoring : Set up monitoring for all cluster components Configure log aggregation : Centralize logs for easier troubleshooting Set up alerting : Create alerts for runner failures or connectivity issues Documentation and Maintenance Document cluster configuration : Record all configuration settings and topology Create operational procedures : Document startup, shutdown, and maintenance procedures Plan scaling procedures : Prepare processes for adding or removing runner nodes Security Hardening Implement access controls : Configure appropriate authentication and authorization Plan security updates : Establish procedures for applying security patches Your distributed execution cluster is now ready for production use.

To configure the connection pool when connecting to MongoDB, use the maxPoolSize setting under mongoProps within the properties.json file. ‚ö†  We recommend the default value for this setting as very low values can significantly affect platform performance.

Although this practice is an available option, property encryption should be performed automatically wherever possible. Adapters To set encryption for Adapters: Within Vault , create the path and key name for the item in question. HINT: Be sure to give it a path and key name that is easy to relate back to the targeted item. Go to Admin Essentials , click the Adapters menu, and select an Adapter . Figure 1: Select Adapter Within the adapter you selected, locate the value you would like to encrypt. Click the Advanced View toggle switch to see the JSON, which may be easier to edit. Figure 2: Advanced Configuration View Remove the existing value. Replace it with \"$SECRET_\" and then the path within Vault to where that secret is stored, followed by \" $KEY_\" ( Hint: there is a space before \"$KEY\" ) and the key within that path. An example would be \"$SECRET_default_password $KEY_key\" which will evaluate to \"password\" . Figure 3: Edit Adapter Click Save and the adapter will automatically restart using Vault to decrypt the changed property.

During a system wide shutdown, all services will stay active until every service has completed their cleanup operations. If operations are completed before the timeout, the platform will exit. If for some reason a service is unable to complete its cleanup operations within the specified shutdown timeout, it will be forcibly closed and a message written to the logs indicating the name of the service that incurred the timeout, and then the platform will exit."]], "markdown": "| Property                             | Type    | Default   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|:-------------------------------------|:--------|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| launchDelay                          | Number  | 0         | The time in seconds the Itential Platform will wait between launching its services.

Itential Platform supports the following log levels.\n| Log Level   | Description                                                                                                                                           |\n|:------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| error       | The most severe level. Indicates a problem, such as a prematurely terminated program.                                                                 |\n| warn        | Used for warning conditions. Warn events may or may not indicate a problem.                                                                           |\n| info        | Used for informational messages.                                                                                                                      |\n| debug       | Used only when debugging problems or transactions. Provides detailed information on messages between Itential Platform adapters and external systems. |\n| trace       | Trace events have a higher verbosity than debug. Trace events are uncommon.                                                                           |\n| spam        | The least severe level. Spam events have the highest verbosity and are rare.                                                                          |\nProduction environments should run at either warn or info level. Running production environments in debug or trace levels will likely generate a large amount of log data and place additional load on the server. A production server should only be configured in debug mode at the request of the Itential Support. The log levels for each application and adapter are configurable at run-time using the Itential Platform UI. When the server is restarted, the log levels for all applications and adapters is returned to the defaults provided by the log_level and console_level properties.\n\nTable: Use the pronghorn.service unit to tail the system journal and filter only Itential Platform messages. journalctl -f -u pronghorn.service For more details about configuring the system journal daemon and using the journalctl command, see the official Red Hat documentation: Using the Journal.\n| Property                  | Type   | Default            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|:--------------------------|:-------|:-------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| description               | String | Logging            | The description property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| log_directory             | String | /var/log/pronghorn | The directory to store Itential Platform log files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| log_filename              | String | pronghorn.log      | The name of the current Itential Platform log file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| log_max_file_size         | Number | 1048576            | The maximum size of each Itential Platform log file in bytes.

IMPORTANT: The longest interval a service can be down before being caught is the sum of deadProcessMaxPeriod and deadProcessCheckInterval. In other words, with the defaults supplied herein, it might be 20 seconds before a service is detected to be down due to the time lag of the check interval when compared against this threshold.

This means the user will not be able to perform CRUD (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) operations on any of the services configured within the system that have the listed service type in this property. Only the admin user will be able to configure these service types. For example, if an admin would like to prevent all users of the system from modifying the AAA adapter then they can do so by specifying \"LDAP\" (if LDAP is the configured AAA system) within the servicesBlacklist property. Remember the values in the servicesBlacklist property are the service type. To find this value, navigate to the service config (e.g. Adapter Configuration) and look for the \"properties\" array and the \"type\" value for the targeted service. Use the value of \"type\" and remember that all adapters of this type will be restricted; in other words, it restricts by type and not by instance. |\n| shutdownTimeout                      | Number  | 3         | The time (seconds) Itential Platform waits before it shuts down its services. This allows a service to have some time to perform any operations it may need to do before it exits. This timeout also applies to the service life-cycle actions \"stop\", \"restart\", and \"crashes\". If a service completes its cleanup operations before the timeout, it will exit. During a system wide shutdown, all services will stay active until every service has completed their cleanup operations. If operations are completed before the timeout, the platform will exit. If for some reason a service is unable to complete its cleanup operations within the specified shutdown timeout, it will be forcibly closed and a message written to the logs indicating the name of the service that incurred the timeout, and then the platform will exit.                                                                                                                             |\nSample System Properties Below is a sample systemProps configuration when used with the Advanced Mode editor.\n\nTable: uiProps ÔÅö This profile property applies to legacy versions of Itential Platform (2023.2 and earlier).

Itential‚Äôs signature platform for NetDevOps, Itential Platform, offers a low-code solution suite for solving today‚Äôs modern network configuration and compliance requirements. Alongside Itential Platform is the Itential Automation Gateway (IAG), a stand-alone integration to popular network automation tools such as Ansible, Terraform and Nornir. For a standardized way to rapidly connect the various protocols required by application vendors, Itential offers two types of resources: adapters and integrations . This best practice guide will help you to understand the use cases for adapters and integrations at Itential. We will begin with an articulation of what adapters and integrations are. From there, we will explore the use cases and strengths of each so you can choose the right path and utilize the best of what Itential has to offer for any given situation. The Evolution of Itential Adapters & Integrations Adapters in Itential were first developed in 2015, and presently there exists over 200 different kinds of open-source adapters. Their primary purpose is to integrate Itential Platform with other network applications and systems. Through Itential‚Äôs evolution, integration models were introduced in December 2020 as a lighter-weight, faster way to integrate external systems. Integration models are better suited for certain use cases where we have OpenAPI 3.0 or Swagger 2.0 available. Next, let‚Äôs explore the specific strengths and differences of adapters versus integrations so that you can choose the right tool for your needs. Building Adapters & Integrations Adapters are code-driven . Apart from 200 opensource adapters, if you need to build new adapters, you can use the Adapter Builder . Adapter Builder requires OpenAPI 3.0 or Swagger 2.0 documentation to generate the adapter and the user then places the automatically generated node.js onto the file system. This allows a high degree of customization available to suit the user‚Äôs needs. Integrations are model-driven and simply require understanding of the desired API calls. Since they are lightweight, they are not placed on the file system. To build an integration, first, you‚Äôll upload the OpenAPI 3.0 or Swagger 2.0 document via the UI, and this automatically creates the Integration Model (stored in a MongoDB Collection). There is an option to validate the document before creating the integration. Deployment To deploy adapters, you will first need to copy the code into the Itential Platform file system. From there, run npm install and then restart the Itential Platform server to start using the adapter. If there are multiple Itential Platform servers in your infrastructure, then either follow the same steps to upload the adapter code and run the npm install on each Itential Platform server or copy the adapter with npm folder and restart the server. For Itential cloud infrastructure, the opensource adapters are already available. For integration models, there is no need to restart the Itential Platform server because the deployment is UI-based. A benefit of using the Integrations Model is that in an infrastructure with multiple Itential Platform servers, all the servers sync up automatically upon deployment. Customization Adapters can be customized according to the needs of the API calls, whereas integrations cannot be customized. Adapters are flexible enough to add or update the API calls whereas integrations are limited to the specification document. For example, if the result of an API call is this: You can customize the adapter call to just return the result as ‚Äústatus.result.data‚Äù , but using an integration you have to deal with the entire status. Memory & CPU (Resources) Integrations can be multi-process and not file system based. They do not use any system resources when idle, and they use less resources than adapters while in-use given that they are multi-process. Integrations can scale up on demand. Adapters, on the other hand, are single processes. These are file system based and they hold a PID (Process ID) that uses memory (~130 MB per adapter instance) even when idle. When you run multiple tasks, adapters use more memory and CPU than integration models. Supported Protocols Adapters give you more flexibility with SOAP, and they work with the following support protocols: HTTP and gRPC. Integrations, on the other hand, only work with the HTTP (REST, SOAP) protocol. Authentication To communicate with external systems, adapters and integrations need to be able to authenticate with the external system. Adapters can be designed to provide support for a variety of authentication standards, such as Basic, OAuth, Static tokens, and other similar methods that do not require manual intervention. Additionally, adapters can accommodate different endpoints for authentication purposes. Integrations support API Key (including AWS), HTTP (Basic) and OAuth2 (only for 2023.1). For integrations, the OpenID Connect scheme is not currently supported. Security Adapters support SSL whereas Integrations support SSL but only for publicly signed certificates. For self-signed certificates to work with Integrations, the keys need to be manually added to the key store. Version Control In terms of version control, whenever a new version of an adapter is available, the adapter needs to be pulled and the node modules reinstalled. After the update, the adapter must be restarted. For integrations you can have multiple versions and create multiple instances per version. Each instance of an integration is independent, consequently requiring a workflow change in the event of a new integration version being used. Migration Integrations are easy to port from one infrastructure to another. For Adapters, one needs to follow the same process as the initial install. Health Checks Adapters are equipped with health checks, which do not count as active calls. These health checks can be configured as startup or intermediate. It‚Äôs important to note these health check calls are not considered as active status checks for other systems, but rather operate as timed polls. In contrast, Integrations do not have the capability for health check calls, and therefore, their operational state, such as availability or status, cannot be checked unlike adapters. Logs Adapters and Integrations both provide multiple levels of logging that includes info, warning, debug, trace, and error. Debug and trace logs are beneficial in troubleshooting, but level should remain warn info in lower environments and error in production. Use Cases Adapters are used whenever there is a requirement of external system connections using REST, SOAP, gRPC, or to build a wrapper over libraries like Mongo. Adapters also are used when you need to add custom calls and when there is no restriction of system resources (On-Prem). Integrations should be used when an OpenAPI 3.0 document is available and there is no need for any customization. When deploying on a Cloud infrastructure, system resources are limited. Feature Comparison Adapters and integrations each serve a unique purpose and have different properties that make them suitable for a variety of needs and use cases. For a quick summary of the differences between adapters and integrations, see the table below.

Yes No", "searchable_text": "Adapters vs. Integrations Updated on Jan 21, 2025 Published on Aug 11, 2023 Export PDF Prev Next Overview Itential‚Äôs automation products not only unify network operations across multiple systems, but they also give a tremendous market advantage to accelerate next-generation, agile networks while maintaining existing infrastructure. Itential‚Äôs signature platform for NetDevOps, Itential Platform, offers a low-code solution suite for solving today‚Äôs modern network configuration and compliance requirements. Alongside Itential Platform is the Itential Automation Gateway (IAG), a stand-alone integration to popular network automation tools such as Ansible, Terraform and Nornir. For a standardized way to rapidly connect the various protocols required by application vendors, Itential offers two types of resources: adapters and integrations . This best practice guide will help you to understand the use cases for adapters and integrations at Itential. We will begin with an articulation of what adapters and integrations are. From there, we will explore the use cases and strengths of each so you can choose the right path and utilize the best of what Itential has to offer for any given situation. The Evolution of Itential Adapters & Integrations Adapters in Itential were first developed in 2015, and presently there exists over 200 different kinds of open-source adapters. Their primary purpose is to integrate Itential Platform with other network applications and systems. Through Itential‚Äôs evolution, integration models were introduced in December 2020 as a lighter-weight, faster way to integrate external systems. Integration models are better suited for certain use cases where we have OpenAPI 3.0 or Swagger 2.0 available. Next, let‚Äôs explore the specific strengths and differences of adapters versus integrations so that you can choose the right tool for your needs. Building Adapters & Integrations Adapters are code-driven . Apart from 200 opensource adapters, if you need to build new adapters, you can use the Adapter Builder . Adapter Builder requires OpenAPI 3.0 or Swagger 2.0 documentation to generate the adapter and the user then places the automatically generated node.js onto the file system. This allows a high degree of customization available to suit the user‚Äôs needs. Integrations are model-driven and simply require understanding of the desired API calls. Since they are lightweight, they are not placed on the file system. To build an integration, first, you‚Äôll upload the OpenAPI 3.0 or Swagger 2.0 document via the UI, and this automatically creates the Integration Model (stored in a MongoDB Collection). There is an option to validate the document before creating the integration. Deployment To deploy adapters, you will first need to copy the code into the Itential Platform file system. From there, run npm install and then restart the Itential Platform server to start using the adapter. If there are multiple Itential Platform servers in your infrastructure, then either follow the same steps to upload the adapter code and run the npm install on each Itential Platform server or copy the adapter with npm folder and restart the server. For Itential cloud infrastructure, the opensource adapters are already available. For integration models, there is no need to restart the Itential Platform server because the deployment is UI-based. A benefit of using the Integrations Model is that in an infrastructure with multiple Itential Platform servers, all the servers sync up automatically upon deployment. Customization Adapters can be customized according to the needs of the API calls, whereas integrations cannot be customized. Adapters are flexible enough to add or update the API calls whereas integrations are limited to the specification document. For example, if the result of an API call is this: You can customize the adapter call to just return the result as ‚Äústatus.result.data‚Äù , but using an integration you have to deal with the entire status. Memory & CPU (Resources) Integrations can be multi-process and not file system based. They do not use any system resources when idle, and they use less resources than adapters while in-use given that they are multi-process. Integrations can scale up on demand. Adapters, on the other hand, are single processes. These are file system based and they hold a PID (Process ID) that uses memory (~130 MB per adapter instance) even when idle. When you run multiple tasks, adapters use more memory and CPU than integration models. Supported Protocols Adapters give you more flexibility with SOAP, and they work with the following support protocols: HTTP and gRPC. Integrations, on the other hand, only work with the HTTP (REST, SOAP) protocol.

This bug has been fixed, ensuring that collections now appear correctly after a refresh, thus improving the overall functionality and user experience of the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ENG-6536  | When configuring setAppRole authentication and enabling Vault Certificate Verification, it was found that IAG was unable to locate the Vault CA File. To rectify this, we have applied a fix in the _get_certificate_path function, ensuring that it accurately retrieves the certificate path value instead of incorrectly using the key as the path. This correction is essential for the proper functioning of the authentication process and enhances the reliability of the system.                                   |\n| ENG-9965  | Users encountered a restriction when navigating to the Scripts tab, where clicking on certain script assets was not permitted. Implemented a fix that modifies the CSS styling to utilize viewport height (vh) units instead. This adjustment ensures that the interface works seamlessly across all screen sizes, allowing users to access the scripts as intended.                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ENG-10372 | An issue was identified where killing a child process or experiencing a workflow failure would lead to a reset of the count for playbooks, scripts, collections, modules, or Terraform, resulting in the loss of previously tracked states. To address this, we have resolved a caching issue within the components that was responsible for the loss of these counts during worfklow process restarts. This fix enhances cache persistence, ensuring that the counts remain intact and reliable even after interruptions. |\n| ENG-10548 | When deleting a Netmiko inventory from the UI, the inventory was not updating. The issue was resolved and now the inventory automatically refreshes appropriately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\nSecurity Changes This section highlights fixes and measures to prevent and minimize security risks and vulnerabilities.\n\nTable: [TABLE_1] | Key ID    | Release Note Security Changes This section highlights fixes and measures to prevent and minimize security risks and vulnerabilities.\n| Key ID    | Release Note                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|:----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ENG-11013 | In response to recent security scans, updated the gunicorn package in Automation Gateway to version 23.0.0 version to maintain security integrity and protect against HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerabilities. |\n", "links": [["https://docs.itential.com/docs/iag-2023217-maintenance-release", 4.0, "Prev"], ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/iag-2023215-maintenance-release", 4.0, "Next"]], "timestamp": 1755318462.9383967, "content_type": "version_info", "priority_score": 8.0, "is_critical": false, "found_keywords": ["2023.2"], "has_tables": true, "has_code_blocks": false, "has_config_examples": false, "has_dependencies": true}

To rectify this, we have applied a fix in the _get_certificate_path function, ensuring that it accurately retrieves the certificate path value instead of incorrectly using the key as the path.

This bug has been fixed, ensuring that collections now appear correctly after a refresh, thus improving the overall functionality and user experience of the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ENG-6536  | When configuring setAppRole authentication and enabling Vault Certificate Verification, it was found that IAG was unable to locate the Vault CA File. To rectify this, we have applied a fix in the _get_certificate_path function, ensuring that it accurately retrieves the certificate path value instead of incorrectly using the key as the path. This correction is essential for the proper functioning of the authentication process and enhances the reliability of the system.                                   |\n| ENG-8270  | A bug was discovered where decorator files were appearing as separate scripts within the IAG user interface, even though they were not applied to the actual script. This caused confusion for users. Implemented a fix that to ensure that decorator files are correctly integrated and do not show up as standalone scripts in the UI, thereby enhancing the user experience and ensuring clarity.                                                                                                                       |\n| ENG-9965  | Users encountered a restriction when navigating to the Scripts tab, where clicking on certain script assets was not permitted. Implemented a fix that modifies the CSS styling to utilize viewport height (vh) units instead.

To address this, we have resolved a caching issue within the components that was responsible for the loss of these counts during worfklow process restarts. This fix enhances cache persistence, ensuring that the counts remain intact and reliable even after interruptions. |\n| ENG-10548 | When deleting a Netmiko inventory from the UI, the inventory was not updating.

Itential Platform Core Updates Active User Visibility - When assigned the correct permissions, this feature will allow administrators to see users who currently have an active login session and optionally log them out. BullMQ Support ‚Äì Itential Platform 2023.2 introduces BullMQ Support, which is a messaging service designed to give a more seamless experience during Itential Platform deployment. Built on top of Redis, it will replace RabbitMQ, reducing the number of dependencies administrators will need to install and manage as part of an IAP deployment. MongoDB Performance Enhancement ‚Äì Itential Platform 2023.2 enables users to exceed the 16MB limit for files stored in MongoDB through GridFS for applications executing workflows in workflow engine. A part of Mongo, GridFS automatically breaks large files into individual pieces, storing them separately and improving platform performance. SAML SSO Support - The 2023.2 feature release now provides customers the ability to authenticate to Itential Platform using SAML SSO. This feature will allow users to authenticate once in their preferred identify management platform, such as Okta or Microsoft, and then connect to the Itential Platform using their SSO credentials. Automation Studio Projects - Projects is a container-like environment where designers can collaborate to create workflows, forms, templates, and JSTs as an entire use case, rather than as individual assets within Automation Studio (\"Studio\"). The assets within the Project will appear in one list and are not separated by type, but instead, are distinguishable by icons. Canvas Enhancements ‚Äì Itential Platform 2023.2 provides canvas search, which gives users the ability to find and highlight tasks on the canvas, allowing them to quickly locate specific items and tasks. This release also includes reference management, which allows users to visualize the path of incoming and outgoing data. Lifecycle Manager Model & Instance Enhancements ‚Äì Itential Platform 2023.2 now enables users to import and export Lifecycle Manager instances between environments. This feature also allows administrators to take periodic backups of instances. Configuration Manager / Operations Manager Compliance for JSON & CLI Arrays - Users can now set rules to specify required components or to specify what order configuration rules must be in. These enhancements add the ability to enforce the management of arrays. Compliance Reporting - Compliance Reporting can now be created and run as an automation, giving you the flexibility to schedule and trigger a compliance check. These automations allow you to group various Golden Configuration compliance checks into a single running effort.
