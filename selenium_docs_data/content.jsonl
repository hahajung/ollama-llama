Multiple automated tests are run prior to code merges alongside testing that is executed regularly on a daily and monthly basis.\nThis guide provides an overview of the types of testing that Itential performs, ranging from specific unit tests to overall system and integration testing. Additionally, it gives recommendations for users of the platform as a way of a reminder to ensure their deployments are stable and deployed without incident.\nTest Coverage\nTest coverage for Itential Platform and IAG is executed via daily automated tests (over 4K tests within 50 repositories) as well as during the delivery of both maintenance and feature releases. This is accomplished using open-source industry standard tools.\nTypes of Testing\nOur product testing includes:\nUnit testing\nby developers within their assigned teams. This is a combination of light automated testing and manual testing.\nHTTP API  testing\n(automated) using\nMocha\nand\nChai\nagainst a real Itential Platform server.\nUser interface (UI)\nand\nend-to-end (E2E) component testing\n(automated) using\nCypress\n.\nPython testing\nwith\nPytest\nfor IAG and other Python components.\nTest Releases\nThere are two types of test releases at Itential: Maintenance and Feature.\nMaintenance\n- This release is targeted to deliver fixes related to bugs and security the first Wednesday of each month. SDETs (Software Developers Engineer in Test) begin testing for this type of release within two weeks before delivery.\nFeature\n- This release is targeted for delivery of the next version of Itential Platform and Itential Automation Gateway (IAG). The intent is to provide one to two Platform feature releases within a year. IAG is released more frequently and typically delivers three to four releases within the year. SDETs (Software Developers Engineer in Test) begin testing for this type of release within 30 to 40 days.\nTest Recommendations\nItential recommends the following test practices for any customized solution (i.e., workflows, JSTs, forms, etc) that utilizes IAP/IAG.\nHave a dedicated staging lab where there are real instances of network devices and services, and always test in the staging lab first.\nDo not just test workflows, but test all components.\nAlso test the JSON forms that are built because JSON forms can dynamically pull server-side data, which means full integration testing of JSON forms in a staging lab.\nAutomated Test Recommendations\nFor automated testing, Itential customers should follow these key practices.\nUse Cypress. There are equally valid alternatives; however, Cypress is the de facto recommendation since it is utilized by Itential for UI testing.\nUse mock adapter data as prescribed by this Itential resource:\nadapters/mock-data\nUse API testing on your workflows as follows:\nstartJob\nto start workflows\ngetJobDetails\nin a loop until there are manual tasks to work\ncompleteJob\nto proceed with the workflow\nMake assertions on the job exit status or the task output.\nUse Cypress E2E testing to assert if other components (e.g., JSON Forms, Command Templates, etc) work.\nPost-Upgrade Recommendations\nItential customers should always test their software instance after every Platform or IAG upgrade. Although Itential runs test workflows through an automated test suite prior to each feature release or scheduled maintenance release, our workflows are invariably different than a customer's specific workflows. Itential also cannot fully scale its test environment to emulate every exact customer environment. Therefore, it is prudent to always test if specific components and solutions still work post-upgrade.\nMoreover, Itential highly recommends an in-depth review of\nRelease Notes\n,\nDeprecation Notices\n, and\nBreaking Changes\nfor each release. Changes between release versions of the Itential software may require you to make changes to your application in order to avoid disruption to your system's implementation, and a critical analysis for any potential impact will best direct your testing efforts for any necessary modifications.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nPrevious article\nAccessibility\nNext article\nProduct Notices", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Testing"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Test Coverage"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Types of Testing"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Test Releases"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Test Recommendations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Automated Test Recommendations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Post-Upgrade Recommendations"}], "code_blocks": [], "scraped_at": 1755873292.7807624}

Itential Adapters can be created using the freely available\nAdapter Builder\n.\nIntegrations\nunder Admin Essentials, are the second generation of Itential’s system integration methods. Itential Integrations require a two-step method.  The first step is to create an\nIntegration Model\nby importing an OpenAPI Spec document.  An\nIntegration\ncan then be created, referencing the Integration Model.\nBoth generations of Itential's System Integration methods can be very useful when integration with external systems is required to build automations to complete an orchestration.\nItential Adapters vs. Itential Integrations\nMany times, the question of which system integration methods should be used is asked.  Both methods are very efficient and effective when integrating with external systems.  There are clear differences between the two methods and why you should use one over the other.  Below is a table that lays out the differences.\nItential Adapters\nItential Integrations\nBuilt using Itential's Adapter Builder.\nUtilizes an OpenAPI specification document.\nAdapter installation requires restart of Itential Platform.\nDoes not require restart of Itential Platform\nNumerous authentication methods.\nAdapter logic is customizable to accommodate unique authentication methods.\nOnly utilizes resources as required, on-demand.\nUpdates to an Adapter requires (at a minimum) restarting the adapter, but may require Platform restart as well.\nUpdates to Integration Models require temporary removal of the integration configs and full removal of the Integration Model, replacing the model and restoring the Integration config.\n\nBeginning with the Platform 6 feature release, the recommended method for optimal system integration is the use of\nIntegrations\n. Adapters are still available for select use cases and will continue to function within the Platform; however, the next generation of system integration via Itential Integrations is considered more efficient and optimized.\nAdapters\nIntegration with Itential Platform is enabled by several adapters:\nAzure/EntraID\n: Requirements to set up and connect to EntraID (formerly Azure), and synchronize EntraID groups with Itential Platform\nLDAP Adapter\n: Information that enables Itential Platform to communicate with and interact with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) servers\nNetwork Adapters\n: Information that bridges how to connect with Ansible Tower, Automation Gateway, and NSO\nOSS Adapters\n: Adapters within this context typically facilitate the integration of OSS tools with Itential's systems\nRADIUS Adapters\n: Adapters that serve as the intermediary between Itential Platform and a RADIUS server for handling authentication and authorization requests\nIntegrations\nThese topics will guide you in how to create Integrations using Integration Models, along with how to use security schema integrations:\nUsing Integration Models\nCreating Integrations from Integration Models\nIntegration Token Management\nSecurity Schemas for Integration Token Management\nOpenAPI 3.1 Specification Extensions in Security Schemas\nMutual TLS (mTLS) Security Schemas\nOAuth2 Authorization Code Flow\nOAUTH2 Scopes Schema\nOpenID Connect (OIDC) Discovery\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nPrevious article\nUpdating AAA Passwords in Itential Platform\nNext article\nAzure AD Setup", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "System Integrations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Itential Adapters vs. Itential Integrations"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Adapters"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Integrations"}], "code_blocks": [], "scraped_at": 1755873367.8408885}

Think of it as your automation workshop—a unified environment where you build workflows, design forms, create templates, and develop data transformations that work together to automate complex network operations.\nStudio brings together multiple specialized applications in one integrated platform, allowing you to design complete automation solutions from concept to deployment.\nWhy use Studio?\nStudio transforms how you approach network automation by providing these key advantages:\nComplete automation toolkit\n— Access all automation development tools in one platform. Design workflows, create input forms, build templates, and develop data transformations within a unified environment instead of using separate, disconnected tools.\nVisual design experience\n— Build automation solutions using intuitive, visual interfaces rather than writing complex code. Studio's drag-and-drop workflow builder and form designers make automation accessible to network engineers, regardless of programming experience.\nBuilt-in testing\n— Test automation assets with mock data before using them in workflows. Validate transformations, Jinja2 templates, TextFSM templates, and command templates using sample data.\nTeam collaboration\n— Work together on automation projects with shared workspaces, version control, and project organization tools that support both individual and team-based development.\nCore applications\nStudio includes several specialized applications, each designed for specific automation tasks:\nWorkflows\n— Create visual, step-by-step automation processes that orchestrate tasks across your network infrastructure. Build everything from simple device configuration updates to complex multi-system orchestration workflows. Address error handling with automated rollbacks and external notifications to ensure reliable automation execution.\nProjects\n— Organize related automation assets into collaborative workspaces. Group workflows, forms, templates, and other assets for specific automation initiatives like device onboarding or compliance management.\nJSON Forms\n— Design custom input forms that collect user data for workflow execution. Create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces that guide users through automation parameters and options.\nTemplates\n— Use TextFSM templates to standardize network device responses and Jinja2 templates to modify or process API responses. Studio comes with pre-loaded TextFSM templates that reduce the work needed to parse responses from various network device types. Build additional reusable templates to standardize how information is collected and processed from network devices and systems.\nTransformations\n— Bridge data format differences between systems using JSON schema transformations. Convert data structures to ensure seamless integration between different network tools and platforms.\nCommand Templates\n— Standardize device command execution with reusable command structures that work across different device types and vendors.\nAnalytic Templates\n— Create standardized data collection and analysis patterns for network monitoring and reporting workflows.\nCommon use cases\nStudio excels in scenarios that require comprehensive automation design and testing:\nMulti-step network operations\n— When you need to automate complex processes that involve multiple systems, devices, and decision points, such as device provisioning workflows that include configuration, testing, and notification.\nCross-platform integration\n— When your automation needs to work with different network vendors, management systems, and data formats, Studio's transformation and template capabilities ensure seamless integration.\nUser-guided automation\n— Create automation that non-technical users can execute safely with Studio's form builders and guided workflows that provide the necessary user interfaces and guardrails.\nCollaborative automation development\n— Enable multiple team members to contribute to automation design, from network engineers defining requirements to developers implementing complex logic.\nAutomation standardization\n— Create consistent, reusable automation patterns across your organization with Studio's project and template features that support standardization efforts.\nIntegration with Itential ecosystem\nStudio serves as the design foundation for the entire Itential automation platform:\nOperations Manager\nexecutes the workflows and automation solutions you create in Studio\nConfiguration Manager\nuses templates and workflows built in Studio for compliance and configuration management\nAdapter Builder\ncreates system integrations that your Studio workflows can use\nAnalytics\nprocesses data using the collection patterns and transformations you design in Studio\nStudio sits at the center of your automation development lifecycle, providing the design environment where you create the automation solutions that run throughout your Itential platform.\nGetting started\nReady to begin building automation solutions with Studio?\nExplore the workflow builder to create your first automation process\nDesign custom forms to collect user input for your workflows\nCreate templates to standardize data collection from your network devices\nSet up projects to organize and collaborate on automation initiatives\nTo get familiar with Studio features and capabilities, see\nNavigating Studio\n.\nNote\nBeginning with Platform 6.0.0, Form Builder was removed from Itential Platform following its deprecation in the 2023.2 release.

A natural part of this is to shift our developer focus toward features and enhancements that utilize newer technologies to ensure all our products are cutting edge. However, we recognize that not all of our customers have the ability to update their Itential Platform environments at the same cadence as our release cycle. To accommodate these requirements, Itential provides\nExtended Support (ES)\nand\nStandard Term Support (STS)\nversions of Itential Platform.\nExtended Support (ES)\nFormerly referred as \"LTS\", long term support\nExtended Support will provide customers the option of a Platform version with a three year support period. The image and table below highlight the differences between an ES and STS version of the Platform.\nFigure: ES & STS Release Schedule\nES Period\nES Phase\nDuration\nCustomer Commitments\n1\nProduct Release and Monthly Maintenance Releases\n24 Months\nWhile the product release is in this phase, it will receive monthly maintenance releases for bug fixes.

Maintenance releases will only include bug fixes and security updates whose inclusion is dependent on the current stage in the ES product release and support cycle (see above).\nStandard Term Support (STS)\nStandard Term Support (STS) provides customers with the ability to integrate new features more quickly into their environments due to the standard six month planned release cycle of major Platform versions. Release and support phases for STS versions are provided in the table below.\nSTS Period\nSTS Phase\nDuration\nCustomer Commitments\n1\nProduct Release and Monthly Maintenance Releases\n12 Months\nWhile the product release is in this phase, it will receive monthly maintenance releases for bug fixes.

While that release is still active in a customer’s environment, the feature that is marked as deprecated will still be available. No backports or bug fixes will introduce deprecations to an existing release.\nBreaking Changes\nBreaking changes can be introduced with the introduction of any release, including an ES release. No backports or bug fixes will introduce breaking changes to an existing release.\nEnd of Maintenance & Support\nAfter two years for STS, or three years for ES, a major Platform software version will reach its End-of-Support (EOS) date. Once the software reaches EOS, Itential will no longer accept support tickets related to the version, and Maintenance Releases for the version will cease to be published.\nItential Platform\nRelease Version\nSupport Model\nRelease Date\nEnd of Maintenance\nEnd of Support\nPlatform 6\nES\nFeb 27, 2025\nAug 27, 2027\nFeb 27, 2028\n2023.2\nSTS\nMay 2, 2024\nNov 2, 2025\nMay 2, 2026\n2023.1\nSTS\nMay 19, 2023\nApril 19, 2025\nAug 19, 2025\n2022.1\nES\nSep 01, 2022\nAug 1, 2025\nFeb 1, 2026\n2021.2\n-\nJan 24, 2022\nJuly 24, 2023\nJan 24, 2024\n2021.1\n-\nJune 25, 2021\nDec 25, 2022\nJune 25, 2023\n2020.2\n-\nJan 5, 2021\nJuly 5, 2022\nJan 5, 2023\nItential Automation Gateway\nTo provide a more streamlined support experience, Itential Automation Gateway (IAG) version lifecycles are aligned with their corresponding Itential Platform (\"Platform\") versions. This alignment ensures that customers have a single End of Support date to track both products when planning upgrades and maintenance schedules. As a result, when a Platform version reaches its End of Support date, the associated IAG version will also reach End of Support on the same date.\nSince IAG versions follow the same lifecycle as Itential Platform, please check Itential's documentation for the exact End of Support date of a particular IAG version.\nBased on the current Platform lifecycle schedule, please note the following End of Support dates for legacy IAG versions:\nRelease Version\nSupport Model\nEnd of Maintenance\nEnd of Support\nIAG/4.x\nES\nAug 27, 2027\nFeb 27, 2028\nIAG/2023.3\nSTS\nNov 2, 2025\nMay 2, 2026\nIAG/2023.2\nSTS\nNov 2, 2025\nMay 2, 2026\nIAG/2023.1\nSTS\nApril 19, 2025\nAug 19, 2025\nIAG/2022.1\nES\nAug 1, 2025\nFeb 1, 2026\n\nNotes:\nIAG versions follow the same support phase structure as their corresponding IAP versions as outlined above.\nMaintenance releases for IAG are coordinated with Itential Platform releases to ensure compatibility.\nSee also:\nIAG Compatibility with Itential Platform\nIAG Versioning\nRPM Version Compatibility (Platform 6)\nWe ensure all our latest RPM packages work seamlessly together, so you can confidently install the most recent version of each component without compatibility concerns. Our engineering team tests every maintenance release to guarantee smooth integration across all RPM packages.\nTo get the best performance and latest features, Itential recommends that you always use the most recent version of each RPM. You'll notice that not every package gets updated in each monthly maintenance release - this is intentional and actually a good thing! When an RPM isn't included in a monthly release, it means that package is already optimized and no changes were necessary. The existing version remains the current, supported release.\nSecurity Updates\nTo remediate high-severity security vulnerabilities, Itential may continue releasing security-only maintenance releases until end-of-support for both Itential Platform and IAG versions, even if no other defect fixes are planned for release.\nSoftware Repository Retention\nItential will periodically remove software from the\nItential Software Repository\nif it has reached its End of Support lifecycle.\nThird-Party Integrations\nAll third-party software version compatibility is documented in the\nPlatform Compatibility\nsection of the Release Notes for each release version (\nProduct Notices → Release Notes → Maintenance Release Version → Platform Compatibility\n). To get the most up-to-date requirements for any third-party integration, including open source, first identify the Itential Platform release version you are using and then refer to the respective release note.\nWhen a third-party integration has reached obsolescence on the Itential Platform, it will no longer be actively supported by the Service Desk. For customers with unsupported third party integrations, Itential may provide limited assistance, where possible, but no bug fixes, workarounds or patches will be provided. As such, the end user will need to upgrade to the newest version of the integration in accordance with version compatibility documented in\nRelease Notes\n.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nPrevious article\nItential Support Desk\nNext article\nAccessibility", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Version Lifecycle"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Extended Support (ES)"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Standard Term Support (STS)"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Monthly Maintenance Releases"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Deprecations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Breaking Changes"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "End of Maintenance & Support"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Itential Platform"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Itential Automation Gateway"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "RPM Version Compatibility (Platform 6)"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Security Updates"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Software Repository Retention"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Third-Party Integrations"}], "code_blocks": [], "scraped_at": 1755873488.7618678}

IAG removes these barriers by providing short-lived automation environments and a structured process for creating user-accessible services.\nIAG services pull code from a Git repository, run the code in a virtual environment, and package it as a service that users can run without specialized knowledge of the underlying tools. IAG transforms automation tools into immutable services with standardized inputs, allowing operators and external teams to easily view and run them.\nIAG supports the following tools:\nAnsible\nPython\nOpenTofu\nFor more information about gateway cluster architecture, see\nArchitecture & Deployment Models\n.\nManaged run-time environments\nIAG creates well-defined, transitory run-time environments that ensure your automations run correctly every time, regardless of deployment location. Each automation has its own environment with consistency across all deployments.\nService based structure\nBy transforming automations into a service model, IAG allows other teams to access and use these automations in a well-defined, structured manner. This lets you continue developing automations while providing team-oriented access. Teams can use the automations without needing to understand the underlying requirements to execute Python, Ansible, or OpenTofu instructions.\nScalable automation\nYou can run IAG as a single user to cleanly manage automations or deploy it in a client-server model where each server can easily replicate services and scale out. As a single binary, IAG doesn't dictate infrastructure requirements or server size.\nOrchestration\nIAG uses Gateway Manager to establish secure connections between your IAG clusters and the Itential Platform. Gateway Manager discovers all of the gateway services associated with your gateway cluster and advertises these services to Itential Platform, enabling the Platform to orchestrate these services as tasks in automation workflows. Your IAG deployment executes the services when Itential Platform calls them during a workflow.\nFor more information, see\nGateway Manager\n.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nPrevious article\nOptimizing Database Size and Performance\nNext article\nWhat's New in IAG 5", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "IAG 5"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "How it works"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Managed run-time environments"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Service based structure"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Scalable automation"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Orchestration"}], "code_blocks": [], "scraped_at": 1755873526.2344563}

An enum specifies a list of constant values assigned to a type. A constant is an identifier (name) for a value that cannot change during the execution of a script/command.\nEssentially, enum is a special \"class\" that represents a group of constants. Once an enum is defined in configuration, you can constrain input to the set of values in the enumeration.\nHow and When to Use Enums to Define Workflow Tasks\nEnums are used to represent a fixed number of possible values. Hence, use enum if there is a definite number of fixed values for any one variable (similar to Boolean values with true or false).\nTo create an\nenum\ninput for a task.\n* Use the\nenum\nkeyword as type.\n* Use\nenum\nwhen you have values that are not going to change, such as months, days of the week, colors, shirt sizes, etc.\nCreate an\nenumerals\narray with all valid variations. In the example below, the\nenumerals\narray consists of the elements: sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, and saturday.\nExample\nThe\nWhatDay\ntask.\n\"methods\"\n:\n[\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"WhatDay\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"Day of the week picker.\"\n,\n\"summary\"\n:\n\"Day of the week picker.\"\n,\n\"deprecated\"\n:\nfalse\n,\n\"roles\"\n:\n[\n\"admin\"\n]\n,\n\"input\"\n:\n[\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"theDay\"\n,\n\"type\"\n:\n\"enum\"\n,\n\"enumerals\"\n:\n[\n\"sunday\"\n,\n\"monday\"\n,\n\"tuesday\"\n,\n\"wednesday\"\n,\n\"thursday\"\n,\n\"friday\"\n,\n\"saturday\"\n]\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"Pick a day of the week.\"\n}\n]\n,\n\"output\"\n:\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"hoursDaylight\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"The numerical value of how many hours of daylight the selected day has.\"\n,\n\"type\"\n:\n\"string\"\n}\n,\n\"task\"\n:\ntrue\n}\n]\nJSON\nCopy\nNote: You can create enumeration values that can be selected when filling a user input field. You can lock enum values to ensure that only the values you have created are selected for user input.\nEnumeration in Workflow Builder\nOnce a task is created:\nNavigate to Workflow Builder.\nAdd the task to the canvas, e.g., the\nWhatDay\ntask example.\nFigure 1: What Day Task\nDouble-click to configure the task.\nChange the field type from\njob\nto\nstatic\n. Notice the pre-populated drop down list containing the days of the week.\nItential Application Schema\nThe following JSON schema can be used as reference for building valid\npronghorn.json\nfiles.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/accessibility-iap", "title": "Accessibility", "text": "Accessibility\nUpdated on  Jan 21, 2025\nPublished on May 19, 2023\nFollow\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nOverview\nMaking Itential Platform accessible means making it usable by everyone and making it possible for everyone to seamlessly connect their IT systems with network technologies for end-to-end network configuration, compliance, and automation.\nThis guide provides accessibility information about the Platform user interface (UI) elements along with information about views and controls that are intuitive and scalable. For simplicity, these guidelines are presented herein as UI/UX checklists to verify key accessibility requirements are met in the design and implementation of the Platform.\nProcess and UI Framework\nItential has built a set of guidelines to follow when creating user interfaces and designs for the Platform. These guidelines aim at targeting WCAG 2.1 conformance (as recommended by\nW3C\n).\nCompliance with WCAG 2 is managed primarily through the RodeoUI library, which controls color, font properties, and other visual details.\nRodeo is built on\nPrime React\n, which claims to be fully accessible and in compliance with Section 508 standards.\nThe Itential Style Guide,\nFlavor\n, provides an overview of all UI elements and guidelines for building interfaces with the RodeoUI library.\nSpecific app designs are based on the\nFlavor\nstyle guide and\nPrime React\ncomponent library.\nInformal accessibility audits of live applications are performed pre-release by the Itential Testing & Verification team.\nVisual Accessibility\nAccessibility begins with design. The following standards are met by all UI components and patterns in\nFigma\n, a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool used at Itential to design and build the Itential Platform.\nThe AA (ideal) level of conformance is the standard for body text compared to background color. For contrast testing,\nColor Review\nis used to test compliance.\nError, warning, and success states must use icons along with text and color. For colorblind and grayscale testing, the\nColor Oracle\nsimulator is used.\nText style properties (minimum requirements) are:\nFont size to at least 14px.\nText enlargement not to exceed 200% (font magnification, not browser zoom).\nLine height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size.\nParagraph spacing to at least 2 times the font size.\nLetter spacing to at least 0.12 times the font size.\nWord spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.\nFunctional Accessibility\nEvery functional test requirement references a WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion target.\nA\nproject checklist\nis used to cover most of the\nWCAG\nrequirements for accessibility and compliance.\nAccessibility is tested across four major browsers: IE11, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox.\nWhere possible, built-in accessibility checkers are used to inspect a page. For example, in Chrome, select Audit → Accessibility → Generate Report.\nIf a page is rendered without CSS, it should still be in a logical order and navigable.\nKeyboard Control (No Mouse)\nItential users can use their keyboard like a mouse to navigate and interact with items onscreen.\nIf it can be clicked, selected, or modified (on input) it must be available from the keyboard (tabbing).\nFor drag and drop functionality, a keyboard-based cut and paste alternative can be offered, or a separate UI for accessibility can be enabled.\nNo keyboard traps. User must always be able to leave a component with the keyboard.\nTabbing must be in a logical top-down, left-right order. A tab-index is used to enforce a certain tabbing order, where needed.\nIf a button or link triggers a dialog or modal window, when the user closes the dialog, they should not be forced back to the top of the page. The element that had focus when the dialog was launched should regain focus when the dialog is closed.\nKeyboard arrows do not trigger an event or function.\nElements with focus have clear visible focus indication.\nWhen an element receives focus, no unexpected action is triggered.\nSelecting or changing a checkbox, radio button, or toggle does not trigger unexpected changes in page context or content.\nThe table below presents a list of keyboard shortcuts and best practices for assistive technologies and accessibility.\nPress this\nTo do this\nEnter\nClick to action\nSpacebar\nToggle\nChoose an item\nOpen a dropdown\nTab\nNavigate in a logical pattern\nKeyboard Arrows\nNavigate inside a dropdown or container\nScreen Reader\nScreen reader is the interface that specifically works within browsers to read content aloud for blind and low vision individuals.\nGives ability for user to pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or auto-updating content.\nDoes not use color as a visual means to convey information - must use icon and text.\nAll Form elements have labels, and labels use the\n<label-for>\nhtml attribute to link a label to an input.\nOffers a \"skip to main content\" button on UIs for screen readers to offer the user a chance to bypass headers and navigation elements that are repeated on every page.\nThe\n<label-for>\nhtml attribute to link a label to an input can be hidden using CSS so it is only visible to the screen reader, but\nDo Not Use\nvisibility:hidden\nor\ndisplay:none\nto hide the link.\nEach page has a title clearly describing the topic or purpose of that page.\nThe\n<title>\ntag in a page header is compliant, and shows page topic in a Browser Tab.\nLinks and buttons that do not have clear text have a title attribute that conveys purpose or target.\nAll symbols and images have alternative text.\nAll images have a descriptive\nalt\nattribute, or an empty string (\nalt=\"\"\n) if it is a purely decorative image.\nPage language is specified in HTML markup.\nValidation uses clear and explicit language for input errors.\nRequired inputs use a proper attribute.\nSections have status roles using the\n<role=\"\">\nattribute\nARIA is used, where appropriate, to better identify the purpose of UI elements.\nTables have header cells describing either the column that comes below it, or the row that comes after it. As a result, table cells are properly marked with a\n“scope”\nattribute so that the screen reader knows how to match the heading to the data.\nReact Specifications\nIn React, the\nfor\nattribute is written as\nhtmlFor\nin JSX.\nSometimes HTML semantics is broken when adding\n<div>\nelements to JSX to make  React code work, especially when working with lists (\n<ol>\n,\n<ul>\nand\n<dl>\n) and the HTML\n<table>\n. In these cases, Itential will use\nReact Fragments\nto group together multiple elements.\nFor example:\nimport\nReact\n,\n{\nFragment\n}\nfrom\n'react'\n;\nfunction\nListItem\n(\n{\nitem\n}\n)\n{\nreturn\n(\n<\nFragment\n>\n<\ndt\n>\n{\nitem\n.\nterm\n}\n<\n/\ndt\n>\n<\ndd\n>\n{\nitem\n.\ndescription\n}\n<\n/\ndd\n>\n<\n/\nFragment\n>\n)\n;\n}\nfunction\nGlossary\n(\nprops\n)\n{\nreturn\n(\n<\ndl\n>\n{\nprops\n.\nitems\n.\nmap\n(\nitem\n=>\n(\n<\nListItem item\n=\n{\nitem\n}\nkey\n=\n{\nitem\n.\nid\n}\n/\n>\n)\n)\n}\n<\n/\ndl\n>\n)\n;\n}\nJavaScript\nCopy\nComponent\nSpecification\nNavSidebar\nMain workspace area requires\nrole=“main”\nSearch\nRequires\nrole=“search”\nDesign Examples\nThe intent of this section is to show examples of the Itential Platform user interface.\nFigure 1: : Advanced Search and Collections View\nFigure 2: Itential Platform Gen 2 Workflow\nAccessibility at Itential\nThe most important aspects of any user interface are navigation and consistent use of components to predict where things are on each page. Itential dedicates extra attention to these areas to inclusively improve the product experience for all types of users.\nWe welcome your feedback on the accessibility of Itential Platform.

It represents entities as resources that include:\nA\nresource model\n, which is a JSON Schema that defines the properties of the resource.\nInstances\n, which are discrete occurrences of the resource.\nActions\n, which use workflows to manage instances according to the properties defined in the resource model.\nHow it works\nYou can use Lifecycle Manager to manage devices in your environment. For example, to manage switches:\nCreate a resource representing a switch\nDefine a resource model that specifies the switch properties you want to manage, such as hostname and port VLANs\nCreate instances to represent each switch in your environment\nDesign actions to manage the properties of these instances\nWhen you use an action to alter an instance property, LCM maintains the state of that property after the action finishes executing. If you design an action that updates a switch hostname, LCM records the hostname in the associated instance. You can view the current hostname even after the action finishes executing.\nNote\nLifecycle Manager tracks entity changes through actions performed within LCM. Out-of-band modifications (changes made directly on devices or through other systems outside of LCM) might not be reflected in LCM. Design your workflow actions to account for these potential discrepancies.\nCapabilities\nLifecycle Manager exists in Itential Platform alongside Studio, Configuration Manager, and Operations Manager.

However, IAG 5.1 is only compatible with Platform 6 and 2023.2. Please note that new features added in various versions of IAG might not be available in all versions of Itential Platform because a specific version of the Platform may lack the functionality to make use of that feature.\nRefer to the following table to identify the IAG versions compatible with Itential Platform versions.\nItential Platform Version\nIAG/2022.1\nIAG/2023.1\nIAG/2023.2\nIAG/2023.3\nIAG/4.3\nIAG/5.1\nItential Cloud - Hosted Version 2023.2 (as of July 15, 2025)\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nPlatform 6.0.0\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n2023.2\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n2023.1\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n2022.1\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\nIf a version of Itential Platform does not provide support for a feature in a version of IAG, the versions remain compatible, but Itential Platform will not be able to use that feature in IAG.\nIAG Versioning Practices\nAll supported versions of IAG are assigned unique identifiers (version numbers) to help manage different versions and releases of the software to ensure customers can access the correct version they need.\nHere's an explanation of how Itential names IAG versions to help you understand the nature of changes between versions:\nComponent Version\n- This identifies the build version of the Platform application (i.e., IAG) distributed in a maintenance release. For each change made to the source code as part of a development build, whether it's a bug fix or improvement, there is a\ncomponent\nversion bump. Components are versioned independently of product release versions. Also, multiple builds can be created for a single\nRelease Version\n.\nRelease Version\n- This identifies the Platform release version of IAG made available to customers in a maintenance release. Release versioning helps to track different iterations of the software and increments each month as part of the maintenance release.\nEach versioning scheme is purposely designed to provide a structured mechanism of releasing and tracking Itential's product versions, enabling developers to identify bugs more efficiently and maintain code integrity.\nIf you need additional support or require more information about Itential's versioning, please contact our\nProduct Support Team\n.\nNSO / Itential Tools\nItential Platform Version\nPackage\nSupported\nPlatform 6\njava\n>=1.70 <1.9.0\n2023.2\njava\n>=1.70 <1.9.0\n2023.1\njava\n>=1.70 <1.9.0\n2022.1\njava\n>=1.70 <1.9.0\n2021.2\njava\n>=1.70 <1.9.0\nNote: The ant package should be installed from your OS distribution.\nNSO Support Policy\nThe Itential Platform supports integration with tested and verified versions of NSO, which may vary for each version of Itential Platform. To this end, Itential will address any errors or flaws that affect the integration of supported NSO versions into Itential Platform. All patch releases (denoted by the third digit in the NSO version number) for supported NSO versions are covered by this policy.\n⚠\nItential is\nnot\nresponsible for the development or support of NSO itself.\nVersions Currently Supported\nSupported versions of NSO are defined in the Release Notes of each version of Itential Platform. In the\nDevices/Services Compatibility\nsection of the release notes, the NSO versions used for testing are listed in the\nNSO Versions\ntable. When viewing this table, note that the\nsupport policy\ndefined above applies. Though a specific patch release for each NSO version may be listed in the table,\nany\npatch release for that NSO version is supported.\n⚠\nWhen planning to integrate NSO into Itential Platform, keep\nlong-term support (LTS)\nversions of NSO in mind. Details regarding the support of LTS versions of NSO can be found in the\nnext section\n.\nPlanned Future Support\nThe following sections outline planned support for NSO that Itential is targeting for the future. As new versions of Itential Platform and NSO are released, testing will be required before certifying support.\nAligning With Cisco Support\nMoving forward, Itential will support any version of NSO that is supported by Cisco at that time, including LTS versions of NSO. For further information about the NSO version lifecycle, refer to the\nCisco End-of-Life and End-of-Sale Notices\n.\nBackporting Support\nWhenever a new version of NSO is released by Cisco, Itential will attempt to certify support of that NSO version for the latest existing release of IP.\nNSO Version Support Matrix\nNSO Version\n2022.1.x\n2023.1.x\n2023.2.x\nPlatform 6.0.x\n5.6.x\n✓\n5.7.x (LTS)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n5.8.x [1]\n✓\n✓\n6.0.x [1]\n✓ [2]\n✓\n✓\n6.1.x (LTS) [1]\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n6.2.x [1]\n✓ [2]\n✓\n✓\n6.3.x [1]\n✓\n✓ [2]\n✓\n6.4.x [1]\n✓\n✓ [2]\n✓\nFootnotes\n[1] NSO version numbers that are forecasted for release in the future are subject to change.\n[2] Itential Platform support for this future version of NSO will be backported once the NSO version is released by Cisco.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nPrevious article\nWhat's New & FAQs\nNext article\nItential Support Desk", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Itential Dependencies"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Monthly Maintenance Release"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Release Notes"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Itential Platform"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Itential Automation Gateway"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Gateway Manager"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Host Operating System"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Itential Platform Server"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "MongoDB Server"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "RabbitMQ Server"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Redis Server"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "HashiCorp Vault"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Automation Gateway"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Ansible"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "IAG Compatibility with Itential Platform"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "IAG Versioning Practices"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "NSO / Itential Tools"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "NSO Support Policy"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Versions Currently Supported"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Planned Future Support"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Aligning With Cisco Support"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Backporting Support"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "NSO Version Support Matrix"}], "code_blocks": [], "scraped_at": 1755873723.8190315}

This allows you to expose adapter functionality using a web API instead of a task or custom code.\nRoute Example\nAdding the\nroute\nproperty to a method in the\npronghorn.json\nfile informs Itential Platform that you would like the route exposed.\nFor example, let's say we have an adapter named\nHelloWorld\n. We can define a route for one of its methods with the following entry in the\npronghorn.json\nfile.\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"hello\"\n,\n\"summary\"\n:\n\"Say hello\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"Example\"\n,\n\"input\"\n:\n[\n]\n,\n\"output\"\n:\n{\n\"type\"\n:\n\"object\"\n,\n\"name\"\n:\n\"return_data\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"A string saying hello back to the user.\"\n}\n,\n\"route\"\n:\n{\n\"verb\"\n:\n\"GET\"\n,\n\"path\"\n:\n\"/hello\"\n}\n,\n\"roles\"\n:\n[\n\"admin\"\n]\n}\nJSON\nCopy\nThis example tells Itential Platform that we would like to define the route\n/hello\nto serve as the interface for the method\nhello\nin our\nHelloWorld\nadapter.\nOne important difference between applications and adapters when it comes to their API routes is that applications use the\ntitle\nproperty in the\npronghorn.json\nfile for their base path, whereas adapters use their\nservice name\n. The\nservice name\nis the name you gave the adapter when creating it. This name can be seen in the\nAdmin Essentials\napplication under the\nAdapters\ndropdown.\nLet's take our\nHelloWorld\nadapter as an example. If we added it to Itential Platform with the name\nHelloWorldAlpha\n, then the\nhello\nmethod could be accessed via the following route:\nhttp://<IAP base path>/HelloWorldAlpha/hello\nIf we added a second\nHelloWorld\nadapter named\nHelloWorldBeta\nthen the hello method would have this route:\nhttp://<IAP base path>/HelloWorldBeta/hello\nReference\nYou can see the routes that Itential Platform creates on the\nHelp Desk\npage under\nAdapter/Integration API\n. Navigate to the icon on the left pane → select\nHelp\n(right side) → click the\nView Documentation\nbutton under\nAdapter/Integration API\n.\nhttp://<IAP base path>/help\nOther Uses\nExposed adapter routes can also be used in\nJSON Forms\nvalidation in the same manner as application routes.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/event-system-itential-platform", "title": "Event System", "text": "Event System\nUpdated on  Feb 20, 2025\nFollow\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nThe event system is a global service object named\neventSystem\nthat is available to application developers in the Itential Platform environment. The\neventSystem\nallows a service to publish information to the Itential Platform environment that other services can react to.\nThe event system has three main methods (which are described in this guide):\neventSystem\n.\npublish\n(\ntopic\n,\npayload\n)\n;\neventSystem\n.\nsubscribe\n(\nsource\n,\ntopic\n,\nhandler\n)\n;\neventSystem\n.\nunsubscribe\n(\nsource\n,\ntopic\n,\nhandler\n)\n;\nJavaScript\nCopy\nEvent Definition\nTo define an event that you want your service to publish, add a\ntopics\nsection to the pronghorn.json of your application. For example:\n\"topics\"\n:\n{\n\"launch\"\n:\n{\n\"type\"\n:\n\"object\"\n,\n\"required\"\n:\n[\n\"rocket\"\n]\n,\n\"properties\"\n:\n{\n\"rocket\"\n:\n{\n}\n}\n}\n,\n\"bananas\"\n:\n{\n}\n}\nJSON\nCopy\nThe above example defines two topics that can be emitted as events by the Itential application,\nlaunch\nand\nbananas\n. The\nlaunch\nobject contains a JSON schema that defines what its event payload should look like. As you can see the property\nrocket\nis required for the event's payload. If it is not present in the payload the event will not be processed. If an event does not match the defined schema it is rejected.\nThe\nbananas\nevent has no requirement for how its payload should look. You can publish as many events as you like.\n\"topics\"\n:\n{\n\"eventName1\"\n:\n{\n-JSON Schema-\n}\n,\n\"eventName2\"\n:\n{\n-JSON Schema-\n}\n.\n    .\n    .\n\"eventNameN\"\n:\n{\n-JSON Schema-\n}\n}\nJSON\nCopy\nNamespace\nThese events are automatically namespaced in the system using the model name of the application (e.g.,\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\n). This allows developers to have events with the same name. Hence, the event name \"rocket\" could be used in both\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\nand\n@itential/app-configuration_manager\n.\nRegistration\nWhen an application connects to Itential Platform it automatically sends all of its defined event topics. Itential Platform adds the event topics to the global list it maintains and then broadcasts the updated global list to all other applications. This allows the other applications to subscribe to the new events.\nⓘ Note:\nCurrently there is no verification of event payload within Itential Platform. This is handled by the\neventSystem\nin the application when it receives an event it is subscribed to.\nSubscription\nTo handle a particular event, call the\neventSystem.subscribe\nmethod. After an event is subscribed to, the event system will call the handler function when it receives the event and verify the payload matches the schema.\neventSystem.subscribe\n(\nsource, topic, handler\n)\nBash\nCopy\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\nsource\nstring\nThe application publishing the event. For example:\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\ntopic\nstring\nThe name of the event topic you care about. For example:\nlaunch\nhandler\nfunction\nA handler function that processes the payload data of the event.\nExample\neventSystem.subscribe\n(\n\"@itential/app-workflow_engine\"\n,\n\"launch\"\n, launchHandler\n)\n;\nBash\nCopy\nUnsubscribing\nTo stop listening for an event, call the\neventSystem.unsubscribe\nmethod. This will cause the event system to stop calling the handler function for a particular event. Unsubscribing tells the event system you no longer care about that event topic.\neventSystem.unsubscribe\n(\nsource, topic, handler\n)\nBash\nCopy\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\nsource\nstring\nThe application publishing the event. For example:\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\ntopic\nstring\nThe name of the event topic you no longer care about. For example:\nlaunch\nhandler\nfunction\nA handler function that previously processed the payload of the event.\nExample\neventSystem.unsubscribe\n(\n\"@itential/app-workflow_engine\"\n,\n\"launch\"\n, launchHandler\n)\n;\nBash\nCopy\nPublish\nTo send an event, call the\neventSystem.publish\nmethod. This will send the event to Itential Platform for broadcast to all the other applications in the Itential Platform environment. Notice there is no source when publishing.
