Please contact the Itential Service Desk for any technical support issues. Information on what to include in your support ticket and related SLA information is outlined here → Service Desk Tickets Itential Instance Not Configured If you have verified the Itential Platform Instances Config table and it has valid entries, this error can be caused due to missing roles. Follow the instructions to add a role for a user under Install & Config . Authentication Issues Invalid credentials will result in an authorization 401 error being returned when trying to integrate with Itential. Connectivity Issues If you do not have access to the Itential server from your ServiceNow server you will get a connection timeout error. This could be related to firewall, ACL, or routing issues. Additionally, if a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) is used instead of an IP address for the Itential server, the ServiceNow server will require the ability to translate the FQDN to an IP address. Another option is to introduce a MID Server which can provide access to your Itential server. If you are using self-signed certificates (e.g. in a development environment) you may need to configure ServiceNow to permit/accept these certificates and hosts. You will need to do the following: Navigate to System Properties → Security Go to the Miscellaneous section located at the bottom. The first item in Trusting Certificates should be checked. The second item in TLS should not be checked. Value should be false : https://<your servicenow host>/sys_properties_list.do?sysparm_query=nameSTARTSWITHcom[…]ient.verify_hostname&sysparm_first_row=1&sysparm_view= Value should be true : https:// <your servicenow host>/sys_properties_list.do?sysparm_query=nameSTARTSWITHcom.glide.communications.trustmanager_trust_all&sysparm_first_row=1&sysparm_vie w= MID Server Issues If you are having issues with certificate or hostname validation with your MID Server in development environments, you can turn off one or more properties (Certificate Chain Check, Hostname Check, and Revocation Check) in the MID Security Policy with the MID Server Section in ServiceNow. Browser Caching We have found issues after upgrading the Itential ServiceNow Application where the GUI for the application is cached on the customer’s browser. This can lead to unusual behavior and synchronization issues between the GUI and the application code on the ServiceNow server. The underlying reason for this is because there's code in the front-end GUI which is providing information to the back-end components on the ServiceNow server. If the front-end is running an older version of code, it could be out-of-sync and not providing the information the newer back-end code is needing. Our recommendation is that all ServiceNow users that access the Itential ServicesNow Application clear the cache on their browsers after they upgrade the application. If they are unable to do this and they see strange behavior after an upgrade, the first step should be to try the application in either incognito mode, or try using a fresh browser. This will eliminate the browser caching issues. Was this article helpful?
