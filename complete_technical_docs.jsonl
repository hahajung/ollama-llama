There are several feature benefits to deploying installation of the Platform in this way, namely: Consolidated Startup Configuration : All startup configuration is now in a single location. User-Defined Environmental Variables : Platform 6 can be configured entirely through environmental variables, including an encryption key. Intelligent Default Values : Itential Platform will automatically generate and pre-fill default common values if a customer does not fully configure their system. Hierarchical Configuration: Configuration will follow a hierarchy that allows customers to configure once and deploy to several locations. Default User : Enable customers to login and configure Itential Platform without first setting up Local AAA (default user). Another improvement to the experience of installing and configuring Itential Platform is the efficiency gain of time and resources during upgrades. Additionally, having this new install allows users to define their own Encryption Key, and provide that key within environmental variables, or via the on-disk properties document. Lastly, these start up features are inherent to Platform 6 and require no installation. Configuration In previous Itential Platform releases, configuration was delegated between a properties.json file and a profile configured within MongoDB. Starting with the Platform 6 release, Itential Platform is now primarily configured through Environment Variables or a functionally equivalent platform.properties configuration file. This functionality replaces the legacy properties.json file. As such,configuration via properties.json is fully deprecated in Platform 6. Starting with Platform 6, the bin installer will no longer copy over the previous properties.json file. To migrate a properties.json file into a new platform.properties file, run this command: Code Block (medium relevance) | Context: Section: Configuration | Context: Starting with Platform 6, the bin installer will no longer copy over the previous properties.json file. To migrate a properties.json file into a new platform.properties file, run this command: | Code: npm run migrate:properties -- --json-file=<path> --out-file=<path> The file generated by this script includes commented out defaults and descriptions for all excluded properties. Itential Platform can be supplied a platform.properties file (or a properties.json ) with the --config-file=<path> launch option. If no --config-file argument is given, Itential Platform will first look in /etc/itential/platform.properties , then the Platform installation directory for a properties.json . If neither file exists, defaults will be used for all configurations not defined by Environment Variables. Profiles are also no longer required for configuration. It is best practice in Platform 6 to use Profiles only for configurations that may change while the server is running, such as prebuiltProps . Additionally, if no configuration for a property exists, Platform 6 will now supply a sensible default value. When conflicting configuration properties are provided, they are resolved in the following priority order: Environment Variable Configuration File Profile Default Value This hierarchy allows users to make a reusable Configuration File and override any necessary properties with Environment Variables for deployment. To view the current configuration in Platform 6, navigate to the Itential Platform → Admin Essentials → Configuration page . From this page view, all configuration properties, their values and their origins are shown (Figure 1). Property File Formats To illustrate the differences in property file formats between Itential Platform release versions, the following samples will demonstrate how property names are displayed. For a complete table of properties in Platform 6 see the Platform Properties and Environment Variables reference . Legacy Platform Legacy properties.json file (Itential Platform 2022.1, 2023.1 and 20232.2) This is also the format used by Profiles .

Platform 6 now enables a default user account to log in and configure any necessary AAA adapters through Admin Essentials. The default user can be configured with the following variables. [TABLE_0] | Technical relevance: medium | Versions: Platform 6, Platform 6, Platform 6, Platform 6 | | platform.properties | Environment Variable | Type | |:----------------------|:-------------------------------|:--------| | default_user_enabled | ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_ENABLED | Boolean | | default_user_username | ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_USERNAME | String | | default_user_password | ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD | String | The primary purpose of the default user is only to set up the first admin account. Once any AAA/SSO adapter is enabled, the default user will be disabled from logging in again, and the Platform should be restarted. Status Page Prior to Platform 6, the Profiles page in Admin Essentials contained “Applications”, “Adapters”, “Configure”, and “Indexing” tabs. Now that Itential Platform can now run without a Profile, the “Applications”, “Adapters”, and “Indexing” tabs were moved for accessibility. The Profiles page in Admin Essentials now only contains the contents of the “Configure” tab. As implied by the location, any configuration done inside of a Profile will only affect that Profile; there is no way to modify a Config File or Environment Variables in Admin Essentials. The contents of the three moved tabs (“Applications”, “Adapters”, and “Indexing”) can be found on the new Status page. These moved tabs still provide the same information and controls as before; Applications gives status information of all configured Platform services, Adapters gives information about configured Adapters, and Indexing gives the status of the MongoDB indexing. Limitations Some known limitations associated with the Platform 6 configuration include: Profiles are still only accessible after connecting to MongoDB. Any configuration related to MongoDB (including encryption) cannot be defined within a Profile. Any Configuration setting that captures the Platform state must only exist in a Profile document. As of Platform 6, the only stateful property is prebuiltProps . The switchActiveProfile API has been deprecated. Switching profiles is only possible when Itential Platform has been configured with a deprecated properties.json file. Environment Variables and Config Files are only read when Itential Platform starts. You must restart the platform to see changes in configuration. Itential Platform will never automatically modify the contents of your platform.properties file or your Environment Variables. Any changes to your platform.properties file must be done outside of the Platform. The Default User is only able to log in before any AAA/SSO Adapter is configured. Once a qualifying Adapter is running, Itential Platform will not accept new logins by the default user, though active sessions with this user may continue to function. Only one configuration file may be supplied to the Platform. If there is both a file at /etc/itential/platform.properties , a legacy properties.json in the installation directory, and no --config-file option is supplied, only the platform.properties file will be used, as it is the first location checked. Should you encounter any issues during configuration or need extra support, please reach out to the Itential Service Desk using the Customer Portal link.

Configuration In previous Itential Platform releases, configuration was delegated between a properties.json file and a profile configured within MongoDB. Starting with the Platform 6 release, Itential Platform is now primarily configured through Environment Variables or a functionally equivalent platform.properties configuration file. This functionality replaces the legacy properties.json file. As such,configuration via properties.json is fully deprecated in Platform 6. Starting with Platform 6, the bin installer will no longer copy over the previous properties.json file. To migrate a properties.json file into a new platform.properties file, run this command: Code Block (medium relevance) | Context: Section: Configuration | Context: Starting with Platform 6, the bin installer will no longer copy over the previous properties.json file. To migrate a properties.json file into a new platform.properties file, run this command: | Code: npm run migrate:properties -- --json-file=<path> --out-file=<path> The file generated by this script includes commented out defaults and descriptions for all excluded properties. Itential Platform can be supplied a platform.properties file (or a properties.json ) with the --config-file=<path> launch option. If no --config-file argument is given, Itential Platform will first look in /etc/itential/platform.properties , then the Platform installation directory for a properties.json . If neither file exists, defaults will be used for all configurations not defined by Environment Variables. Profiles are also no longer required for configuration. It is best practice in Platform 6 to use Profiles only for configurations that may change while the server is running, such as prebuiltProps . Additionally, if no configuration for a property exists, Platform 6 will now supply a sensible default value. When conflicting configuration properties are provided, they are resolved in the following priority order: Environment Variable Configuration File Profile Default Value This hierarchy allows users to make a reusable Configuration File and override any necessary properties with Environment Variables for deployment. To view the current configuration in Platform 6, navigate to the Itential Platform → Admin Essentials → Configuration page . From this page view, all configuration properties, their values and their origins are shown (Figure 1). Property File Formats To illustrate the differences in property file formats between Itential Platform release versions, the following samples will demonstrate how property names are displayed. For a complete table of properties in Platform 6 see the Platform Properties and Environment Variables reference . Legacy Platform Legacy properties.json file (Itential Platform 2022.1, 2023.1 and 20232.2) This is also the format used by Profiles . Code Block (medium relevance) | Context: Section: Legacy Platform | Context: This is also the format used by Profiles. | Versions: platform6 6 | Code: { \"serviceDirectory\": \"dev/services\", \"mongoProps\": { \"db\": \"platform6\" }, \"loggerProps\": { \"log_directory\": \"dev\", \"webserver\": { \"log_directory\": \"dev\" } }, \"authen Platform 6 Here is the equivalent platform.properties Configuration file (Itential Platform 6).

Platform 6 now enables a default user account to log in and configure any necessary AAA adapters through Admin Essentials. The default user can be configured with the following variables. [TABLE_0] | Technical relevance: medium | Versions: Platform 6, Platform 6, Platform 6, Platform 6 | | platform.properties | Environment Variable | Type | |:----------------------|:-------------------------------|:--------| | default_user_enabled | ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_ENABLED | Boolean | | default_user_username | ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_USERNAME | String | | default_user_password | ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD | String | The primary purpose of the default user is only to set up the first admin account. Once any AAA/SSO adapter is enabled, the default user will be disabled from logging in again, and the Platform should be restarted. Status Page Prior to Platform 6, the Profiles page in Admin Essentials contained “Applications”, “Adapters”, “Configure”, and “Indexing” tabs. Now that Itential Platform can now run without a Profile, the “Applications”, “Adapters”, and “Indexing” tabs were moved for accessibility. The Profiles page in Admin Essentials now only contains the contents of the “Configure” tab. As implied by the location, any configuration done inside of a Profile will only affect that Profile; there is no way to modify a Config File or Environment Variables in Admin Essentials. The contents of the three moved tabs (“Applications”, “Adapters”, and “Indexing”) can be found on the new Status page. These moved tabs still provide the same information and controls as before; Applications gives status information of all configured Platform services, Adapters gives information about configured Adapters, and Indexing gives the status of the MongoDB indexing. Limitations Some known limitations associated with the Platform 6 configuration include: Profiles are still only accessible after connecting to MongoDB. Any configuration related to MongoDB (including encryption) cannot be defined within a Profile. Any Configuration setting that captures the Platform state must only exist in a Profile document. As of Platform 6, the only stateful property is prebuiltProps . The switchActiveProfile API has been deprecated. Switching profiles is only possible when Itential Platform has been configured with a deprecated properties.json file. Environment Variables and Config Files are only read when Itential Platform starts. You must restart the platform to see changes in configuration. Itential Platform will never automatically modify the contents of your platform.properties file or your Environment Variables. Any changes to your platform.properties file must be done outside of the Platform. The Default User is only able to log in before any AAA/SSO Adapter is configured. Once a qualifying Adapter is running, Itential Platform will not accept new logins by the default user, though active sessions with this user may continue to function. Only one configuration file may be supplied to the Platform. If there is both a file at /etc/itential/platform.properties , a legacy properties.json in the installation directory, and no --config-file option is supplied, only the platform.properties file will be used, as it is the first location checked. Should you encounter any issues during configuration or need extra support, please reach out to the Itential Service Desk using the Customer Portal link.

If multiple downstream resources can report the same event, or if multiple Itential Platform instances are listening to events from the same downstream resource, multiple event messages may be broadcast in the Itential Platform event system for the same downstream occurrence. In this case, actions listening for those events will execute multiple times. In most cases, however, the desired behavior is to respond only once for each distinct occurrence. For example, event deduplication may be required if an instance of NSO is observed by a cluster of Itential Platform servers. In this scenario, each Itential Platform server will maintain its own individual connection to the NSO server. NETCONF events produced by the NSO server will be observed by all running instances of Itential Platform, resulting in multiple messages being generated in the Itential Platform event system for a single NETCONF event. In this case, Itential Platform event deduplication may be configured to ensure that only one message is emitted to the event bus so that there is only one response to the event from the system as a whole. Configuring Event Deduplication In the active Itential Platform profile, you will need to set the service config of each event producer which requires event deduplication. Once the active profile is configured to enable event deduplication, each service for which events are to be deduplicated must then be configured. The most important settings shown below are active and uniqueProps , which determine the on/off status of the feature, as well as the set of message properties that will be used to determine which messages are duplicates. The uniqueProps allow you to handpick the fields that will be used to evaluate if two events are to be regarded as duplicates. For example, if the values of the three fields specified below ( \"/value/device\" , \"/value/event\" , \"/value/timestamp\" ) are the same between two events, the event is considered as a duplicate. If any of these are different, then the events are not deduplicated. Below is a sample service config for eventDeduplication settings.

The library used to create a message digest uses the system's openssl utility to produce a result. uniqueProps The uniqueProps setting is used to tell the deduplication system which fields define a unique message. The fields specified in this property are used to extract a subset of the message which is then hashed to provide a unique value to the deduplication system. For example, if the uniqueProps property specifies the fields device , event and timestamp , the following messages will be considered as redundant to each other, and two of them will be dropped while the first is emitted through the event system.

In the event that none of the specified fields are found in a message, it is considered unique and subsequent messages like it will not be deduplicated.

These expressions tell Itential Platform which properties should be used when comparing messages, forming an inclusive list. Code Block (medium relevance) | Context: Section: JSON Pointer Array | Code: [ \"/value/device\", \"/value/event\", \"/value/timestamp\" ] Inclusive Mask Object The uniqueProps setting may also be specified as an object with true or false as its leaf values (example below).

Performing a fresh install of Platform 6, which requires you to be aware of the appropriate installation procedures for Adapters and Custom Applications in the new version of the Platform. Before proceeding, here's a few noteworthy differences to be aware of: Alongside the change to RPM for deployment, Itential Platform 6 installs to a different location on-disk than the legacy Platform release versions (22.1/23.1/23.2). For the product to function, it's important to make note of the appropriate location for adapters and custom applications in Platform 6. The installation destination (folder) differs between Platform 6 and the Itential Platform releases (22.1/23.1/23.2). Migration to Platform 6 To migrate, move and copy adapters from your current (legacy) Itential Platform version to the new Platform 6 release: Locate adapters on your current Itential Platform system. Code Block (medium relevance) | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Locate adapters on your current Itential Platform system. | Code: /opt/itential/pronghorn/node_modules/@ itentialopensource Go into an individual adapter.

Code Block (medium relevance) | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Change directory out of the adapter. | Code: cd .. Package and compress the adapter you are working on ( zip , gzip , tar ). Move the compressed adapter to the new Platform 6 system. Change adapter directory to the Platform 6 Services directory. Code Block (medium relevance) | Context: Section: Migration to Platform 6 | Context: Change adapter directory to the Platform 6 Services directory. | Code: /opt/itential/platform/services Decompress the compressed file into the adapter directory. The services directory should contain the individual adapters and not a namespace. Repeat steps 1-9 for all adapters on the current Itential Platform, including any custom adapters that are located in a custom namespace. Follow steps 3 and 4 in the adapter installation section below for each adapter. When you have migrated all of your adapters to Platform 6, follow steps 5-9 of the install below. This is so you will only need to restart the platform once after all adapters have been migrated. Installation To install an adapter: Go to the Itential Platform Services directory: cd /opt/itential/platform/services Clone, unzip, or tar the adapter into your Itential Platform environment. Use one of the methods below: git clone git@gitlab.com:@itentialopensource/adapters/adapter-name unzip adapter-name.zip tar -xvf adapter-name.tar Install the adapter dependencies: cd adapter-name npm install Lint and test the adapter: npm run lint:errors - There should be none. npm run test - All tests should pass. Restart the Itential Platform. Run the following to confirm restart: systemctl restart itential-platform Create an adapter service instance in the Itential Platform Admin Essentials GUI. Configure a service instance configuration for the adapter in the Itential Platform Admin Essentials GUI. Copy the properties from the sampleProperties.json in the adapter directory and place into the inner (second) properties in the Admin Essentials Service Instance Configuration for the adapter. Make all specific changes such as host , port , authentication method, credentials, etc. Set the admin permission role to the adapter for anyone: Building workflows containing an adapter task. Using calls into the adapter for retrieving dynamic data in a JSON form, or within other custom applications. Usage Once the adapter has been installed, configured, and permissions set to the appropriate role, the adapter and its tasks should be available to users of the Itential Platform. Moreover, adapters are flexible with a high degree of customization for a variety of needs and use cases: You can add tasks to a workflow in Automation Studio and then run that workflow. You can add dynamic dropdowns that retrieve the list of data from an adapter. You can integrate the adapter with the Device Broker, which will add devices to Configuration Manager. You can access the adapter methods from your custom applications. You can access the adapter methods through Itential Platform API calls. Limitations & Workarounds A call must exist in the adapter in order to be available. As vendors update APIs, the calls may be missing from adapters. When this occurs, you can use the generic adapter tasks to prevent being blocked while a call is added. Almost all open source adapters come with generic adapter calls that allow you to define endpoints and parameters. These calls can be used when a call is missing from an adapter, or when call parameters have changed. It further allows you to make progress on your use cases while the adapter is being updated to support the additions. Further adapter documentation can be found in the Itential Opensoure library space: Adapters . Logging Adapter debug logs are essential to triage adapter issues. The debug logging that's been enabled includes: OPTIONS, REQUEST and CALL RETURN.

Create a JSON form and add a dynamic dropdown that utilizes an adapter call. For device broker integration: Ensure the system has devices (e.g., Meraki) and there's access to the system. Go to the Admin Essentials GUI to verify broker integration for the adapter through the service instance configuration. Go to Configuration Manager to see if it was able to discover the devices in the down stream system. If not, you may need to confirm the device broker mappings in the adapter. Troubleshooting & Support Typical adapter issues center around configuration and authentication. The adapter sampleProperties should have authentication techniques that were previously used or were documented to work with the adapter. In addition, every open source adapter should have an AUTH.md file that describes the login process and criteria. When using SSL/TLS, you will need to enable SSL in the adapter service instance configuration. This also requires you to provide a ca file or to turn on accept invalid certs . The latter is not recommended for production, but is generally acceptable for development and testing.

This correction is essential for the proper functioning of the authentication process and enhances the reliability of the system.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">ENG-8270</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">A bug was discovered where decorator files were appearing as separate scripts within the IAG user interface, even though they were not applied to the actual script.

To address this, we have resolved a caching issue within the components that was responsible for the loss of these counts during worfklow process restarts.

One of the core strengths of the Itential Automation Platform (IAP) is the agile ability to establish integrations with other network applications, systems and devices by creating your own adapter using the Adapter Builder . As such, Itential is excited to introduce a specific library of technical resources that summarize the configurations and customizations available for adapter generation and integration, along with customized authentication, testing and troubleshooting the install and use of your newly built adapter. At Itential, the information we make available is frequently expanded and updated, so be sure to bookmark this site and check back often. Lastly, go over to the Itential Open Source repository to check out all the adapters that are available and to our product site to see how network connectivity to everything using IAP can enable your business. Authentication This resource describes some of the common ways to set-up adapter authentication to ensure two-way communication between your adapter and the other system. Additional supporting information and examples are also provided for complex methods such as OAUTH and encoding. View Resource Security This resource describes some of the security methods and authentication protocols that users will use to establish secure forms of communication between devices when making a request to an external system. View Resource IAP Service Instance Configurations Most of the flexibility that’s needed to configure your adapter is found in the property definition file, which is a JSON schema file that provides all your property data. This resource will guide you in making changes to your adapter properties, which is done through the Itential Automation Platform. Each property is defined and several examples are given on how properties are used. View Resource Endpoint Configurations To understand the integrations, endpoints and various actions your adapter can take with a system entity, use the resource information provided here on the action.json file. This section covers the field definitions used to define actions within an adapter, and gives you examples on how to modify the file for unique schemas and mock data that can be tested in standalone mode. Also, the adapter schema is used in defining the data that flows to and from an adapter. Since every action in an adapter can have a unique input and output, use the information in this resource to configure the data for each action in your adapter. View Resource Headers Sometimes external systems require certain headers on the API calls. The below article describes how these headers can be added to some or all calls. It also discusses the difference between static and dynamic headers. View Resource Mock Data Mock data is captured and stored in your adapter for purposes of standalone testing, but it won’t test for true authentication. To learn more about using mock data, use the information in this resource to format the mock data files and understand how best to capture responses (data) from the other system. View Resource Code Files The adapter code files provide the Runtime Libraries required for many instant capabilities such as translation, consistent error handling, metrics and encryption. The adapter.js file contains the methods which are exposed to the Itential Automation Platform. This resource will provide details on what’s in the adapter.js, as well as provide examples to help you understand how to make modifications to an adapter call. View Resource Linting & Testing The purpose of testing your adapter is to expose faults in the interactions that take place between the adapter components and the other system. Included in this resource is information on the test files utilized for unit testing and integration testing, as well as the linting script used to find and fix runtime errors. Additional guidance and best practices for adapter testing are presented for you to follow and incorporate when adding tests or test data. View Resource Build an Adapter To create your own adapter, use the Adapter Builder – an interactive, easy-to-use tool that allows you to custom build adapters that integrate with select network applications via the Itential Automation Platform. Once you upload your Swagger, OpenAPI, or Postman Collection document, Adapter Builder will guide you step-by-step to help define your adapter, set properties, and create entities. Adapter Builder even tells you how to install the adapter after it’s built. View Resource Troubleshooting Do you need help with your newly built adapter? Are you unsure of how to make a change to a property to get your adapter working? The Itential Adapter Team is available to help! We have provided resource information on some of the more common troubleshooting areas you may encounter as well as those complex scenarios where additional detail is needed. View Resource Support If you experience any problems or can’t figure out how to make a change, don’t hesitate to contact us. The Itential Adapters Team is here to help.
