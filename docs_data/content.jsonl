Information on handling a force quit is also provided.\nÔÅö\nAlways restart the Platform after properties have been updated. Profile services and properties can be accessed via\nAdmin Essentials\n.\nService & Systemctl\nThere are two Linux-based management tools that provide a way to manage system services:\nservice\nand\nsystemctl\n. In the case of\nservice\n, the command will redirect to\nsystemctl\non systemctl-enabled distributions. Both service and systemctl commands for starting, stopping and restarting services can be run on both CentOS and RHEL distributions.

A course of action to clean up Redis data is required and you must know the\nserverId\nof the Platform  instance killed.\nUse this Redis command to find the\nserverId\nif you do not have it:\nsmembers iap:servers\nIn the Redis CLI, run the following commands to retrieve the health keys:\nsrem iap:servers $IAP_ID\n\nkeys health:*:$IAP_ID\nNext, run each health key through the delete command:\ndel $KEY1\nAlternately, to avoid running\ndel\nmultiple times, use a space-separated list. Each key is the result of the\nkeys\ncommand run previously:\ndel $KEY1 $KEY2 $KEY3 $KEY4\nConsequences if No Cleanup is Performed\nIf a cleanup is not performed, the ramifications are minimal; however, if the Platform is stopped via force quit and never restarted, the Redis memory becomes bloated over time and leads to an \"out-of-memory\" condition. To avoid this altogether, run the cleanup steps above or just simply restart the Platform so it can self-clean.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Managing Itential Platform Services"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Service & Systemctl"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Start"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Stop"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Restart"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Verify Stop/Start Status"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Force Quit"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "How to Handle a Force Quit if the Platform is Never Restarted"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Consequences if No Cleanup is Performed"}], "code_blocks": ["systemctl <command> automation-platform", "systemctl <command> automation-platform", "sudo service pronghorn start", "sudo service pronghorn start", "sudo systemctl start pronghorn", "sudo systemctl start pronghorn", "sudo -u pronghorn node server.js", "sudo -u pronghorn node server.js", "sudo service pronghorn stop", "sudo service pronghorn stop", "sudo systemctl stop pronghorn", "sudo systemctl stop pronghorn", "sudo service pronghorn restart", "sudo service pronghorn restart", "sudo systemctl restart pronghorn", "sudo systemctl restart pronghorn", "sudo less /var/log/pronghorn/pronghorn.logsudo tail -f /var/log/pronghorn/pronghorn.log", "sudo less /var/log/pronghorn/pronghorn.logsudo tail -f /var/log/pronghorn/pronghorn.log", "sudo journalctl -xesudo journalctl -fu pronghorn", "sudo journalctl -xesudo journalctl -fu pronghorn", "srem iap:servers $IAP_ID\n\nkeys health:*:$IAP_ID", "srem iap:servers $IAP_ID\n\nkeys health:*:$IAP_ID", "del $KEY1 $KEY2 $KEY3 $KEY4", "del $KEY1 $KEY2 $KEY3 $KEY4"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-system-search", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/open-api-documentation-itential-platform", "https://itential.document360.io/docs/profile-2"]}
{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/service-brokers-itential-platform", "title": "Service Brokers", "text": "Service Brokers\nUpdated on\nMar 26, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nThis guide explains how to associate an Itential Platform service with a broker.\nWhat Brokering Does\nAssociating a service with an IP broker means the service agrees to implement the broker's interface. Basically, the service will supply a particular set of functions declared by the broker. For example, a broker named\ntrope\nmight support functions\nfoo\n,\nbar\n, and\nbaz\n. If we create a service that implements the\ntrope\nbroker, then it must define the functions\nfoo\n,\nbar\n, and\nbaz\n. If it does not define these functions an error will occur during runtime if the function is called by the brokering system.\nBrokering allows for a service to be used conceptually to perform operations. A concept that could be brokered is operations that are performed on a network device. To illustrate the concept, we will call our example the\ndevice\nbroker. This broker might have functions such as\naddDevice\n,\ngetDevice\n, and\ndeleteDevice\n. Now say that we have three different services that talk to three different network managers that can perform the\naddDevice\n,\ngetDevice\n, and\ndeleteDevice\noperations. We could associate these three services with the\ndevice\nbroker so we can reference the concept of a device instead of a specific service. In other words, you can now perform the\naddDevice\n,\ngetDevice\n, and\ndeleteDevice\noperations by referencing the\ndevice\nbroker instead of one of the three services specifically.\nHow to Associate a Broker\nTo associate a service with a broker or group of brokers add it to the pronghorn.json\nbrokers\narray. You can add the\nbrokers\narray at the root of the configuration if it does not exist. In this pronghorn.json example the\ndevice\nand\nmethod\nbrokers have been added.\n{\n    \"id\": \"@itential/adapter-example\",\n    \"export\": \"EXAMPLE\",\n    \"title\": \"EXAMPLE\",\n    \"src\": \"src.js\",\n    \"type\": \"Adapter\",\n    \"brokers\": [\n      \"device\",\n      \"method\"\n    ],\n    \"roles\": [\n      \"admin\"\n    ],\n    \"topics\": {},\n    \"views\": [],\n    \"methods\": []\n  }\nWhen the service is installed in IP, the broker associations will be added to the service configuration automatically. The service is now associated with the brokers.\n{\n    \"loggerProps\": {\n      \"description\": \"Logging\",\n      \"log_max_files\": 100,\n      \"log_max_file_size\": 1048576,\n      \"log_level\": \"info\",\n      \"log_directory\": \"./logs\",\n      \"log_filename\": \"example.log\",\n      \"console_level\": \"warn\"\n    },\n    \"isEncrypted\": false,\n    \"model\": \"@itential/adapter-example\",\n    \"name\": \"example_adapter\",\n    \"type\": \"Adapter\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"id\": \"example_adapter\",\n      \"type\": \"EXAMPLE\",\n      \"properties\": {},\n      \"groups\": [],\n      \"brokers\": [\n        \"device\",\n        \"method\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Service Brokers"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "What Brokering Does"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "How to Associate a Broker"}], "code_blocks": ["{\n    \"id\": \"@itential/adapter-example\",\n    \"export\": \"EXAMPLE\",\n    \"title\": \"EXAMPLE\",\n    \"src\": \"src.js\",\n    \"type\": \"Adapter\",\n    \"brokers\": [\n      \"device\",\n      \"method\"\n    ],\n    \"roles\": [\n      \"admin\"\n    ],\n    \"topics\": {},\n    \"views\": [],\n    \"methods\": []\n  }", "{\n    \"id\": \"@itential/adapter-example\",\n    \"export\": \"EXAMPLE\",\n    \"title\": \"EXAMPLE\",\n    \"src\": \"src.js\",\n    \"type\": \"Adapter\",\n    \"brokers\": [\n      \"device\",\n      \"method\"\n    ],\n    \"roles\": [\n      \"admin\"\n    ],\n    \"topics\": {},\n    \"views\": [],\n    \"methods\": []\n  }", "{\n    \"loggerProps\": {\n      \"description\": \"Logging\",\n      \"log_max_files\": 100,\n      \"log_max_file_size\": 1048576,\n      \"log_level\": \"info\",\n      \"log_directory\": \"./logs\",\n      \"log_filename\": \"example.log\",\n      \"console_level\": \"warn\"\n    },\n    \"isEncrypted\": false,\n    \"model\": \"@itential/adapter-example\",\n    \"name\": \"example_adapter\",\n    \"type\": \"Adapter\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"id\": \"example_adapter\",\n      \"type\": \"EXAMPLE\",\n      \"properties\": {},\n      \"groups\": [],\n     ", "{\n    \"loggerProps\": {\n      \"description\": \"Logging\",\n      \"log_max_files\": 100,\n      \"log_max_file_size\": 1048576,\n      \"log_level\": \"info\",\n      \"log_directory\": \"./logs\",\n      \"log_filename\": \"example.log\",\n      \"console_level\": \"warn\"\n    },\n    \"isEncrypted\": false,\n    \"model\": \"@itential/adapter-example\",\n    \"name\": \"example_adapter\",\n    \"type\": \"Adapter\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"id\": \"example_adapter\",\n      \"type\": \"EXAMPLE\",\n      \"properties\": {},\n      \"groups\": [],\n     "], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/search-api-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/service-config-property-encryption-itential-platform"]}
{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/sso-saml-authentication", "title": "SAML Authentication", "text": "SSO SAML Authentication\nUpdated on\nApr 29, 2025\nPublished on Mar 14, 2024\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nIdentity Provider Authentication\nBeginning with the 2023.2 release, Itential Platform has expanded its user management capabilities to include Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML. The following providers are supported: Okta, Azure/EntraID, Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS), and PingID.\nTo enable SSO, an\nIdentity Provider (IDP) Config\nmust be created under\nAdmin Essentials\n‚Üí\nAuthorization\n‚Üí\nIdentity Providers\n.\nAlong with enabling an\nIdentity Provider\n, a successful authentication test is required. Upon successful test, a single provider can be enabled at a time. Once an Identity Provider is enabled, all Itential Platform authentication is done via SSO SAML using that config immediately without restart of Itential Platform. Authentication via AAA broker is still supported, but it is disabled when an Identity Provider is enabled. All IDP Configs must be disabled to continue AAA broker authentication usage.\nÔÅö\nNote that in the Itential Platform, an\nIdentity Provider\nis linked as an\nSSO Config\n.\nCreating an Identity Provider\nTo create an Identity Provider, first navigate to\nAdmin Essentials\n‚Üí\nAuthorization\n‚Üí\nIdentity Providers\n. Then, click the\nNew Provider\nbutton. This will prompt you for the name and optional description of the Identity Provider. All providers must use SAML in 2023.2, so that cannot be changed.\nAny number of IDP Configs can be created for a single IDP (Identity Provider). For instance, if two (2) IDP Configs are created for an Okta provider with\nLogin URL\nhttps://exampleapp.oktapreview.com/app/examplesaml/7Y374u1d7/sso/saml\n, separate Itential Platform users will be created for each IDP upon successful authentication, and each will have\nprovenance\ncorresponding to the name of the IDP. Accordingly, a user authenticated from Okta using two (2) separate IDP Configs with username\nexample@email\ncreates two separate Itential Platform users with the same username, but a different provenance.\nFigure 1: Identity Providers Home Page\nFigure 2: Identity Providers Create Dialog\nNewly created Identity Providers are disabled by default and include empty text fields for the required\nIssuer\n,\nLogin URL\n,\nUsername Attribute\n, and\nGroups Attribute\nfields. The\nLogin URL\nis the entry point by which SSO authentication is initiated. The\nIssuer\nmaps to the\nEntity Identifier\nfrom the provider. Identity Providers also require a public signing certificate, which can be retrieved from the IDP and uploaded to Itential Platform. This certificate is used to validate signatures of incoming SAML responses. Below shows the newly created IDP from the above example. These fields are provider specific. Refer to the table at the end of this article for locating configuration values in each provider, as this can change depending on the provider.\nFigure 3: New Identity Provider Created\nThe IDP Config can be saved whenever it is changed. Below is an example of a config with all required fields filled in, as well as an uploaded certificate. Note that every time an Identity Provider is updated, a successful authentication test (via\nTest Connection\n) is required to enable the config in Itential Platform.\nFigure 4: Identity Provider SSO Config\nIdentity Provider Group Mappings\nThe Group Mappings table of an IDP Config maps internal Itential Platform groups to external Identity Provider groups. Upon successful login of a user via SSO, Itential Platform will assign roles from the internal Itential Platform groups mapped to the groups returned by the SAML response from the IDP. In the below example, when\nOkta Example\nis enabled, and a user authenticates via SSO SAML in Itential Platform, if that user is a member of the\nDevelopers\ngroup in\nOkta Example\n, then the user will be assigned all roles in the\npronghornall\nItential Platform group.\nFigure 5: Identity Provider Group Mappings\nFigure 6: New Group Mapping\nTesting Identity Provider\nTo enable an Identity Provider in Itential Platform, you will need to successfully test the config. You can initiate a test by clicking the\nTest Connection\nbutton at the top of the Identity Providers page. This will initiate SSO SAML authentication with the provider in a new tab. Successful tests require the\nProfiles.updateProfile\npermission from the group mappings (at a minimum) to provide a mechanism for disabling the config. Upon successful authentication, the below response is displayed to the user and the tab can be closed. Each new save of an IDP Config will require a new successful test.\nFigure 7: Identity Provider Successful Test\nÔÅö\nOccassionally, the\n‚ÄúTest Connection‚Äù\noperation fails on the first authentication attempt after a new tab is opened. If this occurs, quickly refresh the tab to resolve. Again, this is very intermittent; however, we thought it might be helpful to mention this workaround.\nSSO Login Page\nOnce an Identity Provider is enabled, the Itential Platform authentication method immediately switches to SSO SAML with the enabled config. The active Itential Platform session does not end, but upon logout or session expiration, the enabled config will require login via SSO. Below shows the login page displayed when an Identity Provider is enabled. When the\nSSO Sign In\nbutton is clicked, SSO SAML authentication is initiated. If no Identity Provider is enabled, the normal default login page is used for AAA authentication. Note that the login API can no longer be used if SSO is enabled, but works as normal if it is not enabled.\nFigure 8: Identity Provider Login Screen\nRetrieving Configuration Values for Identity Providers\nThe following table is an attribute mapping of Identity Providers to Itential Platform. Each row corresponds to an identity provider (such as Okta and Azure), and each column is a provider attribute for the mapping, such as\nIssuer\nor\nLogin Url\n. Each table cell contains the location of the property in the IDP, which may or may not be configurable.\nIDP\nIssuer\nLogin URL\nUsername\nOkta\n1. Choose the application.\n2. Go to\nGeneral\n.\n3.

To enable automatic token refreshing and allow callbacks to your application's endpoint, specify the scope and reply (redirect) URL, respectively.\nFigure 9: OAuth 2 Configuration Parameters\nParameter\nDescription\nExample Format\nIdentity Provider\nThe name of the service that authenticates and verifies user identities, acting as a central point for managing credentials.\n{OAuth 2 ProviderName}\nClient ID\nA unique identifier that an application uses to interact with an authorization server.\n0za2hl2inow5Uqc6c357\nClient Secret\nThe\nclient_secret\nis known only to the application and the authorization server. It is the application's own password and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable. A best practice to generate a secure secret is to use a cryptographically-secure library to generate a 256-bit value and then convert it to hexadecimal representation.\n*********\nAuthorization URL\nThe authentication endpoint used by the authorization server to authenticate credentials. This is the URL used to sign in the user.\nhttps://<your-domain>/oauth2/v2/authorize\nToken URL\nThis field holds the endpoint used to exchange the authorization code after successful authorization for a token that will be added to the authorization header (or any other specified destination as per your API).\nhttps://<your_iap_address>:3443/oauth/token\nRefresh URL\nIn most cases, the Refresh URL is the same as the Token URL, which is the endpoint used to refresh your access token for a new one after your current token expires.\nhttps://<your_iap_address>:3443/oauth/token\nScope\nScopes enable your application to only request access to the resources that it needs while also enabling users to control the amount of access that they grant to your application. For example, to enable automatic token refreshing, you will need to specify\noffline_access\nin the scope field to ensure the authorization server returns a refresh token that your OAuth2 provider can use.\noffline_access\nRedirect URL\nDetermines where the OAuth2 server can send responses to complete the authorization flow.\nhttps://<your_iap_address>/auth-callback\nRelated Reading:\nAuthentication and Authorization Flows\nConfiguring OAuth 2.0 Authentication in Microsoft Power Platform\nConfiguring OAUTH2 Inside of Postman in Itential Platform Service Accounts\nOAuth Server Authorization\nOAuth 2.0 in Power Automate\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "SSO SAML Authentication"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Identity Provider Authentication"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Creating an Identity Provider"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Identity Provider Group Mappings"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Testing Identity Provider"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "SSO Login Page"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Retrieving Configuration Values for Identity Providers"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Implementing OAuth2 Configurations"}], "code_blocks": ["https://exampleapp.oktapreview.com/app/examplesaml/7Y374u1d7/sso/saml", "Profiles.updateProfile", "https://localhost:3443/saml/callback", "{OAuth 2 ProviderName}", "https://<your-domain>/oauth2/v2/authorize", "https://<your_iap_address>:3443/oauth/token", "https://<your_iap_address>:3443/oauth/token", "https://<your_iap_address>/auth-callback"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/service-configuration-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/azure-entra-id-saml-sso-set-up-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/azure-saml-sso-set-up-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/pingid", "https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/configure-oauth2-inside-of-postman-itential-platform-service-accounts"]}

This means that a user can provide configurations to fetch\nPre-Built Automations\nfrom multiple repository locations as well as install and manage those Pre-builts in a single IP environment.\nOn this page, the minimum requirements to have a functioning repository in Itential Platform are defined. Instructions on how to create, manage, and delete these Pre-built Automation repository configurations are provided also.\nRepository Configuration Properties\nThe configuration properties for the\n@itentialopensource\nPre-built Automation repository are configured by default on startup of IP.\nThe following properties are required for a Pre-built Automation repository configuration.\nProperty\nDescription\nenabled\nA flag that denotes if the repository configuration is connected or disconnected.\nversionStatus\nSpecified as\ncurrent\nor\nlatest\n. Rendered as \"Show all Versions\" in the configuration, this flag denotes if the content of the repository will show older prebuilts that might or might not be compatible with the local system.

A user has the ability to create, edit, or delete a configuration. In addition to these options, a user can also select to\nView All\nwhich will allow the user to view all of the repository configurations currently on the system. Editing the repository configurations can be done from the\nRepository Config\ndetails page.\nFigure 1: Admin Essentials Repositories\nFigure 2: Manage Repository Configurations\nFigure 3: Edit Repository Config\nAdding a New Repository\nA user can create a new repository configuration by going to the\nRepositories\nmenu item of the Pre-built section of Admin Essentials and selecting the\nCreate\nbutton in the upper left button bar. A dialog will appear, prompting the user to fill in the\nConfiguration Properties\n.\nA user can also create a new repository configuration without using the UI. An API request can be sent to\nPOST /prebuilts-repository/configs\nwith a request body of the following:\n{\n    \"name\": \"test\",\n    \"config\": {\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"versionStatus\": \"current\",\n        \"type\": \"gitlab\",\n        \"hostname\": \"gitlab.com\",\n        \"path\": \"itentialopensource/pre-built-automations\",\n        \"credentials\": {}\n    }\n}\nEditing a Repository\nA user can edit an existing repository configuration by going to the\nRepositories\nmenu item of the Pre-built section of Admin Essentials and selecting\nEdit repository details\n. A dialog will appear, prompting the user to modify each property that can be edited.\nConnecting or Disconnecting a Repository\nA user can connect or disconnect an existing repository configuration by going to the\nRepositories\nmenu item of the Pre-built section of Admin Essentials and selecting the target configuration. A dialog will appear with all of the existing properties for the selected repository configuration. At the top of the dialog there is a toggle that can be switched on/off which represents the repository configuration being 'connected' or 'disconnected'.\nÔÅö\nIf a repository configuration is disconnected, any associated Pre-built Automations installed on the system will no longer be able to receive any updates. Once the repository configurations is reconnected then the Pre-built Automations can resume receiving updates.\nDeleting a Repository\nA user can delete an existing repository configuration by going to the\nRepositories\nmenu item of the Pre-built section of Admin Essentials and selecting the target configuration. Then choose \"Delete\" in the more button at the upper right side. A dialog will appear, prompting the user to select a repository configuration to delete.\nÔÅö\nIf a repository configuration is deleted from IP and that configuration had associated Pre-built Automations that were installed on the system, each of those Pre-built Automations will be updated to a \"local\" configuration. This means the Pre-built Automations is no longer associated with a repository and will not be able to receive updates. Furthermore, if the repository is reconnected and the same Pre-built Automations are installed, they will conflict  with the \"local\" Pre-builts and must be managed accordingly.\nViewing Installed Pre-Builts from Different Repositories\nInstalled pre-builts from different repositories will appear under the\nPre-builts\ntab in Admin Essentials. Each repository config will be listed as a collapsible menu, with the pre-builts from that config listed under it. Pre-builts from connected repositories will have update icons if they are out of sync; pre-builts from disconnected repositories will not check the repository for updates. In addition, pre-builts from deleted repositories will not check for updates (as the repository is no longer accessible), and will also be moved under a\nlocal\nnamespace in the sidebar.\nThe dropdown menu within the\nPre-builts Catalog\nalso allows the user to choose which repository to query when getting a list of pre-builts.

Follow the instructions to add a role for a user under\nInstall & Config\n.\nAuthentication Issues\nInvalid credentials will result in an authorization 401 error being returned when trying to integrate with Itential.\nConnectivity Issues\nIf you do not have access to the Itential server from your ServiceNow server you will get a connection timeout error.  This could be related to firewall, ACL, or routing issues.  Additionally, if a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) is used instead of an IP address for the Itential server, the ServiceNow server will require the ability to translate the FQDN to an IP address. Another option is to introduce a MID Server which can provide access to your Itential server.\nIf you are using self-signed certificates (e.g. in a development environment) you may need to configure ServiceNow to permit/accept these certificates and hosts. You will need to do the following:\nNavigate to\nSystem Properties\n‚Üí\nSecurity\nGo to the Miscellaneous section located at the bottom.\nThe first item in\nTrusting Certificates\nshould be checked.\nThe second item in TLS should\nnot\nbe checked.\nValue should be\nfalse\n:\nhttps://<your servicenow host>/sys_properties_list.do?sysparm_query=nameSTARTSWITHcom[‚Ä¶]ient.verify_hostname&sysparm_first_row=1&sysparm_view=\nValue should be\ntrue\n:\nhttps:// <your servicenow host>/sys_properties_list.do?sysparm_query=nameSTARTSWITHcom.glide.communications.trustmanager_trust_all&sysparm_first_row=1&sysparm_vie w=\nMID Server Issues\nIf you are having issues with certificate or hostname validation with your MID Server in development environments, you can turn off one or more properties (Certificate Chain Check, Hostname Check, and Revocation Check) in the MID Security Policy with the MID Server Section in ServiceNow.\nBrowser Caching\nWe have found issues after upgrading the Itential ServiceNow Application where the GUI for the application is cached on the customer‚Äôs browser. This can lead to unusual behavior and synchronization issues between the GUI and the application code on the ServiceNow server. The underlying reason for this is because there's code in the front-end GUI which is providing information to the back-end components on the ServiceNow server. If the front-end is running an older version of code, it could be out-of-sync and not providing the information the newer back-end code is needing.\nOur recommendation is that all ServiceNow users that access the Itential ServicesNow Application clear the cache on their browsers after they upgrade the application. If they are unable to do this and they see strange behavior after an upgrade, the first step should be to try the application in either incognito mode, or try using a fresh browser. This will eliminate the browser caching issues.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Troubleshooting"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Itential Instance Not Configured"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Authentication Issues"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Connectivity Issues"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "MID Server Issues"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Browser Caching"}], "code_blocks": ["https://<your servicenow host>/sys_properties_list.do?sysparm_query=nameSTARTSWITHcom[‚Ä¶]ient.verify_hostname&sysparm_first_row=1&sysparm_view=", "https://<your servicenow host>/sys_properties_list.do?sysparm_query=nameSTARTSWITHcom[‚Ä¶]ient.verify_hostname&sysparm_first_row=1&sysparm_view=", "https:// <your servicenow host>/sys_properties_list.do?sysparm_query=nameSTARTSWITHcom.glide.communications.trustmanager_trust_all&sysparm_first_row=1&sysparm_vie w=", "https:// <your servicenow host>/sys_properties_list.do?sysparm_query=nameSTARTSWITHcom.glide.communications.trustmanager_trust_all&sysparm_first_row=1&sysparm_vie w="], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/support-help-resources-itential-snow-application", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/faq-itential-automation-services-snow-application", "https://docs.itential.com/v1/docs/install-config-itential-snow"]}

Special characters in the name of a virtual host must be escaped via HTML URL encoding.\n%2Ffoo\nRabbitMQ High Availability Considerations\nWhen deploying Itential Platform in a High Availability topology, several additional steps must be taken to ensure the proper operation of RabbitMQ.\nRabbitMQ Clustering and Message Queue Mirroring\nTo achieve high availability, you must configure RabbitMQ to use clustering and message queue mirroring. A RabbitMQ cluster is a logical grouping of RabbitMQ instances, or nodes. All of the nodes in a RabbitMQ cluster share operational data with each other; however, message queues are not replicated by default.\nTo replicate message queues between the nodes in a cluster, message queue mirroring must be configured. When using message queue mirroring, all changes to a queue are first applied to a leader replica. The leader replica is only present on one node, which is known as the leader node for the relevant queue. After changes are applied to the leader replica, the changes propagate to the mirrors of the queue. Mirrors are copies of a queue that exist on nodes that are not the leader node for the queue.\nItential recommends that at least three (3) nodes are present in a cluster used by Itential Platform.

You should enter the hostname or IPv4 address of each RabbitMQ node in the cluster to the array. When configured in this manner, Itential Platform will failover to another node in the RabbitMQ cluster in the event of a node outage.\nTo add multiple values to the Hosts variable from the Itential Platform profile configuration view:\nEnter the\nhostname\nor IPv4 address of the primary RabbitMQ node in the first field.\nClick\n+ Row\n.

It provides a rich set of features for performing text-based comparisons that can identify when a textual configuration block:\nIs missing from a device configuration.\nShould be removed from a device configuration.\nShould be modified and reapplied to a device configuration.\nWhile the tool can be used to perform basic compliance remediation, this is not its intended purpose in production environments. Its compliance capability works only on the principle of generalized text analysis. As such, it does not have any knowledge of the device it is operating against or the semantics of that device's command-line interface. In addition, compliance remediations that run in this manner are executed in serial. If you are running remediations against multiple devices, they will be applied to one device at a time.\nIn order to achieve more complex, device-specific outcomes, such as using device-specific variables, checking for rogue configurations, and performing remediation at scale, Itential recommends developing automation workflows. In particular,\nperforming auto-remediation at scale is beyond the flexibility and performance capabilities of Golden Configuration.\nItential provides several tools to assist developers in creating workflows for such scenarios, including:\nJinja2 templates for configuration generation.\nTextFSM templating for configuration extraction.\nJSON Schema Transformations (JSTs) for performing data manipulation inside a workflow.\nItential also provides white papers and best practice guides for powerful features such as Itential Automation Gateway extensible device support.\nWhen combined with workflows, templating, extensible devices, and JSTs, the Golden Configuration compliance and remediation capabilities can ease the process of analyzing and correcting your device configurations.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Compliance & Remediation"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/child-job-looping-best-practice-iap", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/configure-oauth2-inside-of-postman-itential-platform-service-accounts"]}

Previously, any task that received 16MB of output would error, generally leading to an errored job. Now, not only will those tasks succeed, but the data output will be properly stored. Tasks that execute later in the job will also be able to access that data and use it as a reference task. Last, the data can be safely stored to job variables, and referenced throughout a job as a job variable.\nSupport Limitations\nIt is important to bear in mind there are some limitations to this support. Extremely large data can lead to system performance degradation that can impact efficiency and response times. Using large data in tasks, especially with concurrent jobs running, can have further performance implications as Workflow Engine has a limit on the total memory it can consume. Additionally, Itential does not support data that is greater than 256MB in size.\nWarning\n‚ö†\nThis limitation applies to the modified payload, which will likely be larger than the data initially passed in. For example, a 240MB payload may grow as Itential Platform performs necesssary modifications to store it in GridFS. In this case, it is very likely the modified payload will exceed 256MB, causing the task to error.\nDisplay Output\nLarge data will not be displayed in the Operations Manager interface by default.

Fixed by adding a required property to handle the oneOf' schema format correctly.\nENG-54\nWhen using JSON Forms with multi-select dropdown fields that have a large number of items the browser becomes unresponsive when searching for an item in a field. To resolve, updated the 'ph-json-form' dropdown widget to include pagination control and default to 100 items max in the dropdown.\nENG-100\nItential Platform  creates many more connections to Redis than necessary and creates situations were a Redis instance can be overloaded causing restart and deployment issues in the Cloud deployments\nENG-105\nWorkflows with template-literal strings (e.g. Hi Test Hi) would display as 'null' for the string input instead of the actual string. Modified workflow logic to properly handle literal task inputs at run time.\nENG-106\nUser was unable to download the artifact.json of a Pre-Built from Admin Essentials that includes a TextFSM or Jinja2 template. Fixed an issue that prevented export (download) of Pre-Builts with Jinja2 or TextFSM templates from Admin Essentials.\nENG-108\nFixed a bug where the 'jobStart' event in a workflow was emitted before sending tasks to the task queue for processing. Modified the order of processing to ensure 'jobStart' is not triggered prematurely.\nENG-208\nFixed a bug in Operations Manager that stopped the Auto-Work functionality from running after opening a child job on the workflow canvas. Auto-Work now starts as expected on a child job.\nENG-209\nResolved an issue with spiked CPU demand and data consumption when making job view queries via API in Operations Manager.\nENG-333\nRestricting role permissions to the Search Compliance Plan Instances API no longer crashes the Config Manager application.\nENG-339\nWhen using Regex in Golden Configuration there is an issue with marking multiple results of the same violation for remediation. Updated the Compliance Report Viewer property use 'issueId' as a unique identifier when selecting config lines for remediation.\nENG-340\nWhen doing load configuration for offline NSO devices in configuration-manage getConfig API will cause or return status code 200 a positive status code with mappi errors. Fixed this false positive issue by keeping checks on mappi errors and returning the correct status code.\nENG-867\nRemoved $id from the workflow input schema calculation that originates from transformation task incoming schemas to fix issue where jobs would not start due to duplicate $ids in the workflow input schema.\nENG-913\nFixed a bug where the principal would fail to generate when authenticating via Service Account while SSO is enabled.\nENG-957\nRunning a transformation no longer displays unsaved changes text.\nENG-958\nFixed a bug by removing an incorrect threshold check in JSON Form Builder. Users can now add Form elements to the second field option in the JSON Form schema combination container via drag-and-drop.\nENG-959\nAdded download button to the project editor sidebar.\nENG-960\nChecked for undefined or null for integer inputs in JST tasks to allow 0 integer inputs.\nENG-1008\nJSON forms can no longer have the same name. If a name already exists, a duplicate name error message is shown.\nENG-1013\nJSON forms can no longer have the same name.\nENG-1018\nFixed an issue that caused the Cancel Job and Revert Job modals to display incorrect name values.\nENG-1030\nImproved the error message that displays when creating a workflow with a duplicate name inside a project.\nENG-1035\nFixed the sort function in the Collection dialog view. Workflows and transformations in Automation Studio now sort correctly by created and last updated date.\nENG-1042\nFixed the sort function in the Collection dialog view. Workflows and transformations in Automation Studio now sort correctly by created and last updated date.\nENG-1049\nTemplates will no longer flash an error message prior to parsing.\nENG-1070\nWhen running a JST, the result from any Set entries, Set values, or String matchAll method will yield an iterator instead of an array which will cause these returns to appear as an empty object.These methods should now return an array as expected.\nENG-1095\nEnhanced GBAC in Admin Essentials by adding read-only permissions. Users assigned to read-only groups can view workflows within Operations Manager but they are not allowed to execute (run) them.\nENG-1137\nFixed incompatible function check for number vs. integer schema types.\nENG-1145\nAdded check within saveWorkflow to determine if there is an existing Project template with the same name as the task.variables.incoming.template. If there, the task.variables.incoming.template is updated to include the\nnamespace._id\nas a prefix in the name.\nENG-1152\nTo determine if a toast should be displayed, added an argument to\nreconcileCallbackSchema\nto detect if it is being called within the\ndeleteAssign\nfunction.\nENG-1279\nFixed the sort function in the Collection dialog view. Workflows and transformations in Automation Studio now sort correctly by created and last updated date.\nENG-1600\nFixed an issue that caused the\nprometheus_metrics\nAPI to reset its count of active sessions every 20 minutes, regardless of whether the tracked sessions had expired or not.\nENG-1621\nThe select all option in the edit group dialog now correctly selects all items for the current page and not other unseen pages.\nENG-2040\nFixed workflow run errors in AG Manager that occurred due to reordered key/value inputs in the database. Modified the task handler to maintain incoming task variables in the same order as the inputs defined on the task.\nENG-2316\nUpdated Rodeo to resolve an issue with using the Studio workflow canvas in Firefox.\nENG-2350\nWhen running a job from a pre-built workflow, the JSON Forms app crashes and the\nvalidateSchema\ntask indefinitely remains in running state. To resolve, implemented additional error handling in the 'validateData' task to check for invalid form data.\nENG-2388\nReduced the number of error notifications generated on logout/network connection failure.\nENG-2505\nWhen opening a transition in Studio, the transition does not display in the UI. Updated the rendering logic in JST Designer to resolve the display issue.\nENG-2556\nFixed an issue where Workflow Engine cleanup was not waiting on task worker deactivation before relinquishing the Event Listener task, resulting in the task being picked back up and orphaned in the running state.\nENG-2588\nIn Automation Studio, when attempting to set a job or task variable source value to a name less than 3 characters in length, the task panel UI rejects the value and resets the variable source to static.\nENG-2622\nWhen trying to delete job errors in Operations Manager, the Delete Jobs dialog would also include successfully completed jobs in the errors table. To resolve, fixed a bug in the dialog to only show failed jobs.\nENG-2697\nWhen viewing workflows and browsing tasks, workflow will no longer flag tasks as changed and lose some variable references. Save will also not be enabled if no changes were made.\nENG-2881\nUpdated the function selection check on load of a transformation to include a check for if the wrapping element was found. This prevents crashing due to missing DOM elements.\nENG-2882\nFixed an issue in JSON Golden Configuration which would cause JSON key-checking rule values to always be treated as string. The key-checking value is now saved as the same type as the value in the JSON.\nENG-2923\nOver time, keys in the Redis datastore accumulate and eventually require the Redis instance to be cleared to avoid crashing Redis. A majority of the keys accumulating through time were due to faulty assumptions in the health checking process and its usage of BullMQ on top of Redis for synchronous request/response communications.  This process was reworked to remove the use request/response between core and the apps and adapters but to instead check existing health status entries in Redis with timestamps to know if an app or adapter had stale health values.\nENG-2932\nWhen importing an existing workflow via pre-built, where the workflow passes validation with no warnings or errors, any warnings or errors from the existing workflow would not be removed. Applied a fix while processing workflows from pre-builts to always update the warnings and errors with the latest validation output.\nENG-2965\nWhen providing a template without an id property to the update legacy template API endpoints, the resulting template is unusable in Itential Platform.  Updated the update and create legacy template endpoints to ensure the id property matches the provided name to prevent issues using the template and the update legacy template endpoints to return an error if no id is provided.\nENG-3034\nFixed an issue where a JSON Form with a dropdown dependency that contains special characters would not function as expected.\nENG-3047\nReset the order of operations in Operations Manager for the import and export of JSON Forms and Transformations via automation triggers.\nENG-3142\nWhen attempting to view a template, Automation Studio no longer returns an error and stops working.\nENG-3143\nFixed migration scripts for Configuration Manager to automatically execute on Itential Platform  startup.\nENG-3195\nWhen doing unit tests in adapter-nso, observed an unnecessary (not required) empty device string check added inside the BuildTemplateAction function. Removed unnecessary empty string checks to enhance code quality by removing unnecessary checks.\nENG-3312\nThe boolean options for the\npass_on_null\nparameters in a JST query task can now be selected when users hover their mouse pointer (cursor).\nENG-3320\nSome child job loop configurations involving JSTs would incorrectly report validation errors in the workflow validation API. Updated the validation method to correctly format JST related child job properties when validating a workflow.\nENG-3349\nSearches for existing Templates with the same name will be overwritten when importing Pre-builts and updating the existing\nid\nwith new data.\nENG-3551\nModified how Itential Platform initializes JSON Form data upon import by adding a new migration script.\nENG-3888\nWhen creating a callback function in JST Designer via a method card, connecting a constant value input to a non-constant value parameter causes the function to be generated incorrectly. Due to this, the function's incoming schema is incorrect and is deselected from the method as incompatible. Applied a fix in JST Designer to ensure the function is generated correctly.\nENG-3933\nFixed a bug with the automation studio/JST-Designer method panel would not re-open after closing. Customers can open/close methods panel in the JST Editor as expected.\nENG-4248\nWhen Itential Cloud is restarted after configuring a large number of Integration Models, the startup time increased and there was high CPU usage. Implemented a fix to improve the encoding/decoding process for Integration OpenAPI models.\nENG-4352\nImplemented a fix to resolve UI issue that occurred when using the JSON Forms 'RenderJsonSchema task to render a large JSON object.\nENG-4407\nThe evaluation task was missing an editable description field for the task. To fix the issue, added a details tab with editable description field to the Eval task.\nENG-4483\nWhen passing HTML into the message field of the view data task, the HTML was rendered incorrectly. HTML is now rendered correctly in the message field of the View Data task.\nENG-4489\nMoving an asset from one project to another or to a new project was removing the incorrect asset from the original project. Project assets now moved correctly.\nENG-4489\nMoving an asset from one project to another or a new project was removing the incorrect asset from the original project. Project assets now move correctly.\nENG-4645\nWith multiple child job task in a workflow, the Input Job Variable doesnot hold the selection if user navigates to 2nd child job task and then come  back again to first child job. It happens if task window is kept open.\nENG-4687\nAdded url sanitization (URI encoding) so that links to assets with special characters correctly navigate.\nENG-4689\nThe user experience of integration import was not very clear when schema validation fails on import. Improved UX by adding schema validation errors to the import modal and directing user to the modal on the toast on import.\nENG-4705\nTransformation functions do not render as expected in JST Designer if there is a function within the transformation that contains double quotes in its name. Fixed the rendering issues when opening functions in JST Designer.\nENG-4715\nWhen setting an operand source type to null in the evaluation task then saving the task, it incorrectly displays the type as object instead of null. Updated the source type dropdown to display null if the value is null.\nENG-4819\nFixed an issue where circular JSON Schema $ref keywords would cause workflow engine to infinitly recurse and then crash when calculating inputSchema/outputSchema with a maximum call stack size error\nENG-4845\nWhen trying to move a pre-seeded template into a project, the dialog option to move them was disabled. Fixed this to allow for pre-seeded templates to be moved into a project.\nENG-4854\nIf you open a corrupted transformation when you already have a transformation open in Automation Studio and then attempt to delete the transformation, it will delete the document you already had open. Updated the delete transformation dialog to display and delete the correct transformation document.\nENG-4858\nItential Platform would crash in some scenarios when sent invalid SNMP requests. Invalid SNMP requests are now gracefully handled and will not cause a crash.\nENG-4874\nWhen checking the adapter's status in the API after a JSON RPC connectivity issue, the adapter will display as degraded until it is restarted, regardless of current connectivity. Applied a fix in the NSO adapter that was causing the adapter to remain degraded even when connectivity was restored so that the adapter now returns to a connected state without needing a restart.\nENG-4941\nThere is no longer a UI crash when configuring a file upload field and then a dropdown on a JSON Form.\nENG-5468\nFixed an issue where users' git token data was being leaked into workflow and legacy form export documents.\nENG-5726\nAdded support for importing JSON form documents that implement multiple validations on a single input\nENG-5755\nIn scenarios where an Itential Platform  cluster is not fully shut down during an upgrade, the new version of app and adapter service models would not take effect. Cluster-wide service model declarations where enhanced to ensure the most up-to-date version is applied whenever an Itential Platform  service comes online.\nENG-5780\nThe MongoDB driver for Node.js contained a memory leak in its implementation of collection watchers. Itential Platform has upgraded from 5.7.0 of the driver to 5.9.0, the version which contains the fix for the memory leak.\nENG-5832\nFixed an issue with Compliance Plans that would prevent plan instances executed via workflows to show up in the plan's 'Reports' tab.\nENG-5861\nFixed an issue with JSON form elements, where any form layering (container/schema combination) is assumed to be a binding configuration (and fail to parse) when at least one actual binding exists\nENG-5918\nWhen passing an array with indexed schemas into an iterative array in JST Designer, making a connection from an index of the incoming array to any method would cause the JST to stop rendering correctly. Fixed a rendering issue within JST Designer that was causing rendering to break after making connections from an array's contents within a function..\nENG-5978\nWhen using the switch method in JST Designer, adding >10 cases will cause assignments after the 10th to not work and the cases to reorder on save or export of the transformation. Fixed the switch method to ensure all assignments work correctly and the order of cases is maintained.\nENG-6301\nImproved the URL sanitation that occurs when navigating to assets with special characters.\nENG-6311\nWhen using the export and import API in the Service Catalog on Itential Platform  version 2023.2, the operation fails due to an issue with the ObjectId reference in the updated MongoDB driver. The fix corrects the ObjectId reference, ensuring that the export and import API in the Service Catalog functions as expected.\nENG-6465\nThe runComplianceForDevice task would not run compliance for a tree if the specified device only existed in the device group. Updated runComplianceForDevice to include devices that are only defined in a device group.\nENG-6499\nWhen upgrading a workflow that has a JST with a reference to a job variable with some name AND a child job that contains a JST with a reference to a job variable that shares the same name in versions 23.2 and later, trying to run the workflow will cause a validation error on the schema. Fixed the shared-nested JST input job variable name schema validation collision during workflow upgrade in 23.2 and later that was causing schema validation errors when attempting to run that upgraded workflow.\nENG-6533\nWhen running a transformation, nested default and const keywords are not being used if an assignment is made from the parent object. Updated our logic for obtaining instance data to check for nested default and const values within incoming schemas of type object.\nENG-6603\nPreviously, fields within a JSON Form schema combination would not respect the value of the 'required' property when previewing the form. This ticket ensures that said fields will now accurately reflect the user's configuration.\nENG-6641\nWhen trying to type a negative number into an integer or number field, the minus sign is ignored and the workflow zooms out. Added support for negative numbers.\nENG-6666\nFixed issue where when moving assets from the global space into a single Project space the child workflow references were broken.\nENG-6688\nFixed an issue in Golden Configuration that would cause incorrect compliance failures when a line contained regular expressions.\nENG-6713\nWhen viewing an errored task in Operations Manager, the text could extend beyond the viewable area. Updated the task Error tab in Operations Manager to display the entirety of any error message.\nENG-6725\nWhen making changes to a Golden Config in Configuration Manager, an invalid JSON would cause the config to be un-savable and yet the user would see no error message. Moved JSON parsing of the Golden Config under a code block with error handling which spits out the JSON error to the user instead.\nENG-6898\nEnhanced validation on open of a project to prevent rendering issues when opening a corrupted project.\nENG-7144\nJSON Forms Dropdown Search works properly when there are multiple pages.\nENG-7253\nFixed a bug with HTTP methods where returning a code without sanitization would cause the platform to crash. Added sanitization of HTTP API error code response to prevent crash of Itential Platform.\nENG-7438\nWhen running a transformation that contains schema keys with special characters without a default keyword set the transformation fails when the revertToDefaultValue option is set to true. Updated the run transformation logic to ensure the provided input is used in this case.\nENG-7453\nWhen opening a function that is used as a function step, the step object is corrupted which causes runtime issues if the step is part of a conditional path e.g. if...else or switch paths. Updated the open function logic to prevent the step object from being corrupted.\nENG-7465\nUpdated the form schema to allow for null default values on a numberField.\nENG-7550\nImplemented RSA public key and Key ID (KID) variable logging for JSON Web Token (JWT) failure.\nENG-7910\nFixed the setup of Itential Platform' s systemd unit file for\nsystemctl restart\nand\nsystemctl stop\n, allowing it to clean up its child services and preventing race conditions that resulted in an unclean redis state. Changes apply to all released versions of Itential Platform.\nENG-7973\nWhen an IAG task was run and no Automation Gateway adapter was available to handle it, the task would enter the success state. An opt-in configuration option was added to Automation Gateway Manager to cause these tasks to enter the error state instead.\nENG-8032\nDuplicate labels in a JSON form dynamic dropdown are now supported.\nENG-8303\nFixed the ability to export a workflow that has a configured JST on looping childJob task that is missing at the time of export\nENG-8305\nWhen creating a big number of golden configuration tree nodes in Config Manager, the last couple of nodes' pop over menu was hidden from the browser due to in-correct menu location. Fixed the menu position from bottom to left so every nodes can show pop over menu.\nENG-8493\nFixed a bug in processing Integration Models with operationIds that contained special characters (not a-z A-Z or _) that was causing the associated tasks to be considered invalid.\nENG-8577\nFixed an issue where a success notification would incorrectly show when all task instances for a compliance runs failed to execute.\nENG-8587\nFixed a bug in workflow validation that resulted in attempts to save, import, or run a workflow that contained certain JSTs to error with Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type').\nENG-9084\nGolden Configuration regex did not support certain special characters such as brackets. Updated Configuration Manager to support such special characters.\nENG-9204\nFixed unit tests issues relating to itential-utils discovery updates.\nENG-9413\nDisabled problematic line wrapping feature for task data code editors to avoid page crashes due to high RAM consumption.\nENG-9442\nJST functions containing function steps are not rendering their methods and transitions on the canvas.

Once initialization is complete, Itential Platform reads the\nproperties.json\nfile to get its basic configuration.\nAdditional configurations supported by the\nproperties.json\ninclude\nserverName\nand the\nserverId\nproperty, which are described below.\nServer Name Property\n‚ö†\nThe\nserverName\nproperty was\ndeprecated\nin the 2023.1 release and scheduled for removal in the Platform 6 release. The\nreplacement\nproperty is\nserverId\n.\nRefer to ‚ûü\nDeprecation of the ServerName Property\nThe\nserverName\nproperty allows administrators to define a uniquely identifying name for each Itential Platform server in their environment.\nProperty Name\nType\nDescription\nserverName\nString\nSpecifies the name that the server uses to identify itself. Any valid string can be used, but it is suggested that each name is unique to its environment. If a string is not provided,\nserverName\ndefaults to using a hashed value derived from the MAC address and Itential Platform port values of the server.\nNote:\nThe\n/status\nAPI call returns the name of the server containing the current database. If\nserverName\nis missing or invalid, the\n/status\nAPI will return a null reference value.\nSample Configurations\nThe configuration examples presented below show unique names that easily identify each server.\nExample 1\n\"serverName\": \"ecs-1.example.com\"\nExample 2\n\"serverName\": \"ECSH01234\"\nServerId Property\nThe\nserverId\nproperty allows admins to define a uniquely identifying name for each Itential Platform server in their environment. The\nserverId\nvalue is set in the properties.json file, and it provides a user-friendly, consistent way to set a server name. Moreover, by using\nserverId\nvalues, admins no longer have to rely on generated IP addresses. Lastly,\nserverId\nvalues can be utilized in a Blue-Green deployment.\nSample Configurations\nSingle Server\nThis example shows a unique name to easily identify the server.\n\"serverId\": \"iap-1\"\nMulti-Server\nThis advanced configuration shows three (3) unique server names in a primary data center and three (3) in a secondary data center.\nPRIMARY DATACENTER\n\"serverId\": \"IAP1.primary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP2.primary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP3.primary\"\nSECONDARY DATACENTER\n\"serverId\": \"IAP1.secondary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP2.secondary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP3.secondary\"\nImplementing the ServerId\nWhen changing (or adding) the\nserverId\nvalue while restarting Itential Platform, any tasks in the ‚Äúrunning‚Äù state that are\nNOT\nin the task types list below will be orphaned.\nTask Types\n- childJob\n- manual\n- forEach\n- eventListener\nThis will only be an issue when the\nserverId\nvalue is first set or changed. Each subsequent restart will not have orphaned jobs as long as the\nserverId\nhas not been changed. Itential recommends that admins pause the task worker and have no running jobs when setting the\nserverId\n.\nIf an Itential Platform stack has a Disaster Recovery (DR) implementation, it is important to ensure the DR Itential Platform cluster does not contain duplicate\nserverId\nvalues from the primary cluster. At the moment, Itential Platform only checks for duplicate serverIds at the cluster level, not the global level. If duplicate serverIds exist, it is possible for tasks to be orphaned when the load balancer switches from the DR to the primary cluster.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Server Name & ServerId in the Properties JSON"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Server Name Property"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Sample Configurations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "ServerId Property"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Sample Configurations"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Single Server"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Multi-Server"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Implementing the ServerId"}], "code_blocks": ["\"serverName\": \"ecs-1.example.com\"", "\"serverName\": \"ecs-1.example.com\"", "\"serverName\": \"ECSH01234\"", "\"serverName\": \"ECSH01234\"", "PRIMARY DATACENTER\n\"serverId\": \"IAP1.primary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP2.primary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP3.primary\"", "PRIMARY DATACENTER\n\"serverId\": \"IAP1.primary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP2.primary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP3.primary\"", "SECONDARY DATACENTER\n\"serverId\": \"IAP1.secondary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP2.secondary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP3.secondary\"", "SECONDARY DATACENTER\n\"serverId\": \"IAP1.secondary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP2.secondary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP3.secondary\""], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/redis-config-health-monitoring-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/service-configuration-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/server-name-property-deprecation-2023-1"]}

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/monitoring-itential-platform", "title": "Monitoring", "text": "Monitoring\nUpdated on\nJan 27, 2025\nPublished on Mar 5, 2024\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nTo maximize availability and ensure consistent performance, Itential recommends the following to monitor Itential Platform. The examples provided here are designed to configure the application for monitoring and to receive actionable alerts.\nBasic Monitoring\nThe\n/health/status\nroute requires no login that can be used for basic monitoring. This route is appropriate to use by a load balancer to determine if an individual node is healthy. Itential Platform will return a 200 when healthy. Any other response or lack of response should be interpreted as unhealthy. It is recommended to set the timeout for this request to 1 second.\nÔÅö\nEffective with Itential Platform 2023.1, the\nGET /status\nAPI is deprecated and targeted for replacement in 2023.2. The replacement API,\n/health/status\n, reports the health of all apps and adapters. Refer to the posted notice:\nDeprecation of Status API\n.\nRequest\nGET /health/status HTTP/1.1\nHost: *some-iap-host*:3000\nAccept: /\nHealthy Response\nThe following example shows a healthy response (i.e., apps, adapters, Redis, Mongo, RabbitMQ is healthy).\nÔÅö\nIn the example, the\nserverId\nand\nServerName\nis a customization. You are responsible for modifying to suit your particular environment. See the\nRelated Reading\nfor important information.\n{\n  \"host\":\"automation-platform-20231-stable-0\",\n  \"serverId\":\"582672c5a088e6f0ca182723e1471805179faf272e1b5750e12bc06f962b13ee\",\n  \"serverName\":null,\n  \"services\":[\n   {\n     \"service\":\"redis\",\n     \"status\":\"running\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"service\":\"mongo\",\n     \"status\":\"running\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"service\":\"vault\",\n     \"status\":\"running\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"service\":\"rabbitmq\",\n     \"status\":\"running\"\n   }\n  ],\n  \"timestamp\":1711633372837,\n  \"apps\":\"running\",\n  \"adapters\":\"running\"\n}\nNote: A healthy response from tential Platform 2023.2.x will not include \"service\":\"rabbitMQ\".\nUnhealthy Response\nIf there are any failed applications, the following example shows a degraded (unhealthy) response. The failed applications can be viewed from the\nAdmin Essentials - Alerts\ndashboard.\n{\n  \"host\":\"automation-platform-20231-stable-0\",\n  \"serverId\":\"582672c5a088e6f0ca182723e1471805179faf272e1b5750e12bc06f962b13ee\",\n  \"serverName\":null,\n  \"services\":[\n   {\n     \"service\":\"redis\",\n     \"status\":\"running\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"service\":\"mongo\",\n     \"status\":\"running\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"service\":\"vault\",\n     \"status\":\"running\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"service\":\"rabbitmq\",\n     \"status\":\"running\"\n   }\n  ],\n  \"timestamp\":1711633372837,\n  \"apps\":\"degraded\",\n  \"adapters\":\"running\"\n}\nNote: An unhealthy response from Itential Platform 2023.2.x will not include \"service\":\"rabbitMQ\".\nApplication and Adapter Monitoring\nItential also recommends that you monitor individual applications and adapters to determine if they are healthy. Itential Platform has two routes to monitor apps and adapters, with each requiring a valid session token.\nApplication Monitoring\nFor each application in the results array careful attention should be given to the\nstate\nfield.  If it does not say\nRUNNING\nthen the application should be considered unhealthy.  The\nuptime\n,\nmemoryUsage\n, and\ncpuUsage\nfields can be tracked to monitor how consumption of these resources changes for better or worse over time.\nRequest\nGET /health/applications?token=*some-iap-token* HTTP/1.1\nHost: *some-iap-host*:3000\nAccept: /\nResponse\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"AdminEssentials\",\n      \"package_id\": \"@itential/app-admin_essentials\",\n      \"version\": \"3.5.64-2021.2.50.0\",\n      \"type\": \"Application\",\n      \"description\": \"Itential Platform's administration suite.\",\n      \"state\": \"RUNNING\",\n      \"connection\": null,\n      \"uptime\": 320.914691654,\n      \"memoryUsage\": {\n        \"rss\": 52662272,\n        \"heapTotal\": 29638656,\n        \"heapUsed\": 27756488,\n        \"external\": 38208460,\n        \"arrayBuffers\": 36697945\n      },\n      \"cpuUsage\": {\n        \"user\": 1284858,\n        \"system\": 167948\n      },\n      \"pid\": 15283,\n      \"logger\": {\n        \"console\": \"info\",\n        \"file\": \"info\",\n        \"syslog\": \"warning\"\n      },\n      \"routePrefix\": \"admin\",\n      \"prevUptime\": 206.380886528\n    },\n    ...more applications...\n  ]\n}\nAdapter Monitoring\nFor each adapter in the results array careful attention should be given to the state field.  If it does not say\nRUNNING\nthen the adapter should be considered unhealthy. Adapters have an additional\nconnection.state\nfield that indicates if the adapter is currently passing its health check to the target system. Anything other than\nONLINE\nshould be considered unhealthy. The\nuptime\n,\nmemoryUsage\n, and\ncpuUsage\nfields can be tracked to monitor how consumption of these resources changes for better or worse over time.\nRequest\nGET /health/adapters?token=*some-iap-token* HTTP/1.1\nHost: *some-iap-host*:3000\nAccept: /\nResponse\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"local_aaa\",\n      \"package_id\": \"@itential/adapter-local_aaa\",\n      \"version\": \"4.3.1-2021.2.3.0\",\n      \"type\": \"Adapter\",\n      \"description\": \"Simple AAA against local persistence store.\",\n      \"state\": \"RUNNING\",\n      \"connection\": {\n        \"state\": \"ONLINE\"\n      },\n      \"uptime\": 804.227121682,\n      \"memoryUsage\": {\n        \"rss\": 62124032,\n        \"heapTotal\": 36909056,\n        \"heapUsed\": 34986384,\n        \"external\": 56421712,\n        \"arrayBuffers\": 54911197\n      },\n      \"cpuUsage\": {\n        \"user\": 1989815,\n        \"system\": 231054\n      },\n      \"pid\": 15568,\n      \"logger\": {\n        \"console\": \"info\",\n        \"file\": \"info\",\n        \"syslog\": \"warning\"\n      },\n      \"routePrefix\": \"local_aaa\",\n      \"prevUptime\": 426.752105274\n    }\n    ...more adapters...\n  ]\n}\nSNMP Traps\nItential Platform also produces SNMP Traps that can be leveraged to perform alerting when certain events occur.

By setting the\nadapterStrategy\nproperty, an administrator of Itential Platform can better direct how device-bound calls interact with external/southbound systems. Additionally, an exception can be setup for the\nrunCommand\nAPIs and workflow tasks if the order needs to be further controlled.\nNote:\nAny custom adapter that has implemented the device broker methods would come next after the configured preferential order has been exhausted.\nCurrently Supported\nValues\nStrategy Types\ndevice\nAdapter Types\nAutomationGateway\nNSO\nException\nrunCommand\nSample Adapter Strategy Properties\n\"adapterStrategy\" : {\n  \"device\": {\n    \"adapterTypes\": [\n        \"AutomationGateway\",\n        \"NSO\"\n    ],\n    \"exceptions\": {\n        \"runCommand\": \"NSO\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe properties of the\nadapterStrategy\nobject include the type of strategy, and currently\ndevice\nis the only one supported.

Under that section you can set the default order of the provider. In the example above, the calls that are shown in the lists below will prefer\nAutomationGateway\nover\nNSO\n. These names are types of adapters and not names of adapter instances defined by the user such as\nnso45\nor\nnso46\n. If for some reason the preferred provider cannot fulfill the request, Itential Platform will try the next one on the list. Lastly, if a custom adapter implements the device broker, then it will be attempted next. If all adapters have tried to fulfill the request and fail, an error is returned.\nThe\nexceptions\nobject contains key/value pairs that represent specific function level overrides.

See the tables below for the specific calls that are affected.\nWhen Itential Platform communicates with its registered providers it will call them in the order defined in the adapter strategy. Based on the example above Itential Platform will call any\nAutomationGateway\nproviders first, then any\nNSO\nproviders, then any providers not listed in the strategy; unless the call is\nrunCommand\nwhere it will call the\nNSO\nprovider first.

In Linux, only\nroot\nor\nsetuid\napplications can bind to ports below 1024. Please refer to\nPrivileged Ports\nto learn more on running services at specific ports.\nTo workaround this limitation and run Itential Platform over port 443, it will require setting\nHAProxy\nto listen on 443 and forward to localhost 3443.\nloggerProps\nThe logger properties control where Itential Platform will store its log files, how much space to dedicate to log storage, and the verbosity levels of the log messages that will be stored. Itential Platform supports the following log levels.\nLog Level\nDescription\nerror\nThe most severe level. Indicates a problem, such as a prematurely terminated program.\nwarn\nUsed for warning conditions. Warn events may or may not indicate a problem.\ninfo\nUsed for informational messages.\ndebug\nUsed only when debugging problems or transactions. Provides detailed information on messages between Itential Platform adapters and external systems.\ntrace\nTrace events have a higher verbosity than debug. Trace events are uncommon.\nspam\nThe least severe level. Spam events have the highest verbosity and are rare.\nProduction environments should run at either warn or info level. Running production environments in debug or trace levels will likely generate a large amount of log data and place additional load on the server. A production server should only be configured in debug mode at the request of the Itential Support.\nItential Platform provides native support for rotation of the\npronghorn.log\nfile. Administrators can define the total allocated storage for logs by configuring the maximum file size and maximum number of files. For example, if the maximum file size is 1 MB and the total number of files is 100, the total space consumed by\npronghorn.log\nfiles will be 100 MB. Be sure the disk that holds the Itential Platform logs contains enough space for Itential Platform to exercise a full log rotation cycle (100 MB).\nThe log levels for each application and adapter are configurable at run-time using the Itential Platform UI. When the server is restarted, the log levels for all applications and adapters is returned to the defaults provided by the\nlog_level\nand\nconsole_level\nproperties.\nItential Platform allows for the verbosity of its console logging to be configured. For\nsystemd\nbased operating systems, this console logging is controlled by the system journal. The system journal may contain application life cycle error messages that are not capable of being written to the\npronghorn.log\nfile itself. The system journal should be reviewed for errors and warnings during any troubleshooting sessions. The system journal is also written to\n/var/log/messages\non many systems. The storage required to store the system journal and\n/var/log/messages\nfiles should also be considered during the storage planning phases.\nUse the following command to monitor the system journal.\njournalctl -f\nUse the\npronghorn.service\nunit to tail the system journal and filter only Itential Platform messages.\njournalctl -f -u pronghorn.service\nFor more details about configuring the system journal daemon and using the\njournalctl\ncommand, see the official Red Hat documentation:\nUsing the Journal\n.\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\ndescription\nString\nLogging\nThe description property.\nlog_directory\nString\n/var/log/pronghorn\nThe directory to store Itential Platform log files.\nlog_filename\nString\npronghorn.log\nThe name of the current Itential Platform log file.\nlog_max_file_size\nNumber\n1048576\nThe maximum size of each Itential Platform log file in bytes.

To configure the number of times Itential Platform will attempt to retry a failed service, set the\nmaxRetries\nproperty. When the number of times Itential Platform restarts a service exceeds the maxiumum number allowed in\nmaxRetries\n, all attempts to restart the service will stop. The count will then reset if the number of milliseconds configured within the\nretryResetTimer\nproperty has elapsed between any two retry attempts.\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\nmaxRetries\nInteger\n10\nMaximum number of retries for a service to fail before Itential Platform will no longer attempt to restart it.\nretryResetTimer\nInteger\n60000\nAmount of time (ms) between each retry before the count (see\nmaxRetries\n) will reset.\nSample Retry Strategy Properties\n\"retryStrategy\" : {\n  \"maxRetries\": 15,\n  \"retryResetTimer\": 2500\n}\nCare should be taken when configuring each of these properties as they work together to achieve the best retry strategy. For instance,\nretryResetTimer\ncan be configured to account for occasional crashes (even expected daily crashes) by having the counter reset after a short period to avoid reaching the\nmaxRetries\nthreshold for retry activity to stop.\nsystemProps\nThe following table presents the\nsystemProps\nthat may be configured.\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\nlaunchDelay\nNumber\n0\nThe time in seconds the Itential Platform will wait between launching its services. This can be used to manage the resource usage incurred by starting many services at the same time.\nlaunchTimeout\nNumber\n600\nThe time in seconds the Itential Platform will wait for a service registration. If a service has not registered itself to Itential Platform within this time frame, it will consider it lost.\nserviceHealthCheckInterval\nNumber\n5\nDetermines how often services update their health data. Measured in seconds. Default: 5 seconds\nMinimum: 1\nserviceHealthCheckUnhealthyThreshold\nNumber\n3\nDetermines how many health check intervals a service can miss before it is considered offline. Measured in number of intervals (also in seconds when multiplied by the interval setting). Default: 3 missed health checks\nMinimum: 1\ndeadProcessCheck\nBoolean\nfalse\nIf true, Itential Platform will perform a health check on its services in timed intervals set by the\ndeadProcessCheckInterval\n. If a process is considered dead it will be restarted.\ndeadProcessCheckInterval\nNumber\n5\nThe interval in seconds the Itential Platform will check the health of its services. This check interval works in conjunction with\ndeadProcessMaxPeriod\nto define when Itential Platform considers the service lost.\ndeadProcessMaxPeriod\nNumber\n15\nThe threshold in seconds after which Itential Platform considers a service lost if it has not received a health update. At each check interval (see\ndeadProcessCheckInterval\n), if the last received healthcheck for this service is longer than the\ndeadProcessMaxPeriod\n, then Itential Platform will then consider the service lost.\nIMPORTANT: The longest interval a service can be down before being caught is the sum of\ndeadProcessMaxPeriod\nand\ndeadProcessCheckInterval\n. In other words, with the defaults supplied herein, it might be 20 seconds before a service is detected to be down due to the time lag of the check interval when compared against this threshold. Keep this in mind if you modify these settings.\nexternalRequestTimeout\nNumber\n5\nThe timeout for external API requests. Measured in seconds. Minimum: 1\nMaximum: 120\ndeviceCountPollingInterval\nNumber\n24\nThe interval for how often Itential Platform polls for the number of devices. Measured in hours. Minimum: 1\nMaximum: 168\nservicesBlacklist\nArray\n[]\nA list of service types that will be \"blacklisted\" for the current user. This means the user will not be able to perform CRUD (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) operations on any of the services configured within the system that have the listed service type in this property. Only the\nadmin\nuser will be able to configure these service types. For example, if an admin would like to prevent all users of the system from modifying the AAA adapter then they can do so by specifying \"LDAP\" (if LDAP is the configured AAA system) within the\nservicesBlacklist\nproperty. Remember the values in the\nservicesBlacklist\nproperty are the\nservice type\n. To find this value, navigate to the service config (e.g. Adapter Configuration) and look for the \"properties\" array and the \"type\" value for the targeted service. Use the value of \"type\" and remember that all adapters of this type will be restricted; in other words, it restricts by type and not by instance.\nshutdownTimeout\nNumber\n3\nThe time (seconds) Itential Platform waits before it shuts down its services. This allows a service to have some time to perform any operations it may need to do before it exits. This timeout also applies to the service life-cycle actions \"stop\", \"restart\", and \"crashes\". If a service completes its cleanup operations before the timeout, it will exit. During a system wide shutdown, all services will stay active until every service has completed their cleanup operations. If operations are completed before the timeout, the platform will exit. If for some reason a service is unable to complete its cleanup operations within the specified shutdown timeout, it will be forcibly closed and a message written to the logs indicating the name of the service that incurred the timeout, and then the platform will exit.\nSample System Properties\nBelow is a sample\nsystemProps\nconfiguration when used with the\nAdvanced Mode\neditor.\n\"systemProps\": {\n  \"launchDelay\": 0,\n  \"launchTimeout\": 60,\n  \"serviceHealthCheckInterval\": 5,\n  \"serviceHealthCheckUnhealthyThreshold\": 3,\n  \"deadProcessCheck\": false,\n  \"deadProcessCheckInterval\": 5,\n  \"deadProcessMaxPeriod\": 15,\n  \"externalRequestTimeout\": 5,\n  \"deviceCountPollingInterval\": 24,\n  \"servicesBlacklist\": [ \"NSO\", \"local_aaa\", \"GitHub:v5\" ],\n  \"shutdownTimeout\": 3\n}\nuiProps\nÔÅö\nThis profile property applies to legacy versions of Itential Platform (2023.2 and earlier).\nThe UI properties is captured by the\nuiProps\nobject.

Multiple automated tests are run prior to code merges alongside testing that is executed regularly on a daily and monthly basis.\nThis guide provides an overview of the types of testing that Itential performs, ranging from specific unit tests to overall system and integration testing. Additionally, it gives recommendations for users of the platform as a way of a reminder to ensure their deployments are stable and deployed without incident.\nTest Coverage\nTest coverage for Itential Platform and IAG is executed via daily automated tests (over 4K tests within 50 repositories) as well as during the delivery of both maintenance and feature releases. This is accomplished using open-source industry standard tools.\nTypes of Testing\nOur product testing includes:\nUnit testing\nby developers within their assigned teams. This is a combination of light automated testing and manual testing.\nHTTP API  testing\n(automated) using\nMocha\nand\nChai\nagainst a real Itential Platform server.\nUser interface (UI)\nand\nend-to-end (E2E) component testing\n(automated) using\nCypress\n.\nPython testing\nwith\nPytest\nfor IAG and other Python components.\nTest Releases\nThere are two types of test releases at Itential: Maintenance and Feature.\nMaintenance\n- This release is targeted to deliver fixes related to bugs and security the first Wednesday of each month. SDETs (Software Developers Engineer in Test) begin testing for this type of release within two weeks before delivery.\nFeature\n- This release is targeted for delivery of the next version of Itential Platform and Itential Automation Gateway (IAG). The intent is to provide one to two Platform feature releases within a year. IAG is released more frequently and typically delivers three to four releases within the year. SDETs (Software Developers Engineer in Test) begin testing for this type of release within 30 to 40 days.\nTest Recommendations\nItential recommends the following test practices for any customized solution (i.e., workflows, JSTs, forms, etc) that utilizes IAP/IAG.\nHave a dedicated staging lab where there are real instances of network devices and services, and always test in the staging lab first.\nDo not just test workflows, but test all components.\nAlso test the JSON forms that are built because JSON forms can dynamically pull server-side data, which means full integration testing of JSON forms in a staging lab.\nAutomated Test Recommendations\nFor automated testing, Itential customers should follow these key practices.\nUse Cypress. There are equally valid alternatives; however, Cypress is the de facto recommendation since it is utilized by Itential for UI testing.\nUse mock adapter data as prescribed by this Itential resource:\nadapters/mock-data\nUse API testing on your workflows as follows:\nstartJob\nto start workflows\ngetJobDetails\nin a loop until there are manual tasks to work\ncompleteJob\nto proceed with the workflow\nMake assertions on the job exit status or the task output.\nUse Cypress E2E testing to assert if other components (e.g., JSON Forms, Command Templates, etc) work.\nPost-Upgrade Recommendations\nItential customers should always test their software instance after every Platform or IAG upgrade. Although Itential runs test workflows through an automated test suite prior to each feature release or scheduled maintenance release, our workflows are invariably different than a customer's specific workflows. Itential also cannot fully scale its test environment to emulate every exact customer environment. Therefore, it is prudent to always test if specific components and solutions still work post-upgrade.\nMoreover, Itential highly recommends an in-depth review of\nRelease Notes\n,\nDeprecation Notices\n, and\nBreaking Changes\nfor each release. Changes between release versions of the Itential software may require you to make changes to your application in order to avoid disruption to your system's implementation, and a critical analysis for any potential impact will best direct your testing efforts for any necessary modifications.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Testing"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Test Coverage"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Types of Testing"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Test Releases"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Test Recommendations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Automated Test Recommendations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Post-Upgrade Recommendations"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/accessibility-iap", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-product-notices", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/monthly-maintenance-release-notes", "https://docs.itential.com/v1/docs/product-notices-deprecations", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/breaking-changes-5"]}

As a best practice, Itential recommends using a\nchildJob\nloop.\nUsing\nChildJob\nLooping\nIn workflow design, there may be some scenarios where it is best to use a\nchildJobLoop\ninstead of the\nforEach\ntask. Using\nchildJobLoop\nsimplifies the readability of workflows and promotes modularity without having to maintain looping logic in multiple places throughout the workflow. It is also a better way of doing loops (sequential and parallel) through a\nchildJob\ntask.\nTask\nTask Description\nBest Practice Recommendation\nforEach\nExecutes a loop inside a job by iterating over each item in an array.\nReplace with\nchildJob\nusing a ‚ÄúLoop Type‚Äù property.\nTask Conversion Process\nThe main components to converting a\nforEach\ntask to a\nchildLoop\ntask include:\nThe conversion of the looped task to a job of its own.\nThe handler task that iterates over an array.\nThe input and output variables of the\nchildJob\n.\nHere are the steps:\nCreate a new workflow for the looped tasks in the\nforEach\ntask.\nReplace the\nforEach\ntask in the original worklow with the\nchildJob\ntask and set the\nWorkflow\nto the child workflow created in the previous step.\nSet the\nloopType\nto sequential or parallel.\nSet the\nloopArray\nto the referenced\ndataArray\n. Ensure the items in the\nloopArray\nare objects.\nAll the workflow details involved in the task conversion process are illustrated in the examples below.\nPass Inputs Directly to a Child Job (Basic Example)\nParent Workflow\nIn the starting workflow (Figure 1), the\nforEach\ntask is iterating over an array\n[1,2,3]\n. For each iteration, the task is making a REST call to an API endpoint.\nFigure 1\nCreate the Child Workflow\nNext, create a child workflow for the task that is being looped (Figure 2). As a suggestion, it is easier to clone the original workflow and leave only the looping tasks.\nFigure 2\nReplace forEach with childJob\nGo back to the parent workflow and remove the\nforEach\ntask. Replace it with\nchildJob\n.\nFigure 3\nSet the Loop Type\nOpen the task details for the\nchildJob\ntask and update the\nWorkflow\n,\nLoop Type\nand\nLoop Array\nproperty fields with the corresponding values. Use\nSequential\nfor the\nLoop Type\n. Click\nSave\nto retain your changes.\nFigure 4\nConvert Array to Object\nFor the array passed to the\nchildJob\ntask, the values need to be objects. Go back to the parent workflow and open the ‚ÄúNew Job Variable‚Äù. Change the\ndata_array\ninput to\n[{},{},{}]\n(Figure 5). Click\nSave\nto retain your changes.\nFigure 5\nRun Workflow\nOnce the ‚ÄúNew Job Variable‚Äù is updated, click the\nRun\nbutton (\n‚ñ∂\n) to execute the workflow and successfully complete the conversion activity.\nUse Transformations to Pass Inputs to a Child Job (Advanced Example)\nTo build on the basic example presented above, let's explore an alternate mechanism which might be useful in some scenarios.\nRestore Parent Workflow\nOpen the ‚ÄúNew Job Variable‚Äù and change the\ndata_array\ninput to to\n‚Äú[1,2,3]‚Äù\n. Click\nSave\nto restore the parent workflow back to its original state.\nNext, to minimize some of the complexity of manually converting the input array, you can use a JST to map how the\nLoop Array\npasses input values to the childjob.\nCreate a JST\nOpen the task details for the\nchildJob\ntask. Click the plus (\n+\n) icon next to the\nTransformation\nfield to create a JST that can map the\nLoop Array\nto input values for the childjob workflow.\nFigure 6\nSet the Outgoing Schema\nOn the JST page, set the outgoing schema with an id of\nnum\nand type of 'integer'. This allows you to pass in the\ndata_array\nvariable to the outgoing schema using the original\n[1,2,3]\ninput array from the parent workflow. Save and close the JST.\nFigure 7\nInput for the childJob Task\nNext, open task details for the\nviewData\ntask. For the\nmessage\nvariable, change the\nReference task\nto\njob\nand the\nReference variable\nto\nmessage\nas shown in Figure 8. Click\nSave\nto update the\nviewData\ntask.\nFigure 8\nUse the JST configured earlier to pass the\n$id\nof\nmessage\nrather than\nnum\n. This creates the\ndata_array\nobject\n[{\"message\":1},{\"message\":2},{\"message\":3}\nthat is passed to the\nchildJob\ntask.\nFigure 9\nSave\nthe transformation and then go back to the parent workflow and click the\nRun\nbutton (\n‚ñ∂\n). Once you ‚Äúwork‚Äù the childjob, you will see the\nRest Call Output\nas shown Figure 10.\nFigure 10\nOutput for the childJob Task\nLastly, if the parent workflow requires the output of the\nchildJob\ntask, then use the output data from\njob_details\n. In this case, add the\nviewData\ntask and use it to pass in the\njob_details\n.\nFigure 11\nNext, pass in the\njob_details\noutput to the\nbody\nvariable.\nFigure 12\nRun the parent workflow and \"work\" each childjob\nviewData\ntask. As shown in Figure 13, the\njob_details\nof the\nchildJob\ntask will look something like this in the output.\nFigure 13\nEach of the loop items will contain the job variables for the job that was completed; however, you will notice no job variables are available. To get the output of the REST API call, go back to the child job in designer mode, choose the\nRestCall\ntask, and then select (check) the\nJob Variables\nbox under\nOutgoing\n.\nFigure 14\nOnce you run the parent workflow, you will then get the output in\njob_details\nfor the\nchildJob\ntask for each iteration (Figure 15).\nFigure 15\nRelated Resources\nItential Video: How to Loop Child Jobs in IAP Workflows\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "ChildJob Looping in Workflow Design"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "UsingChildJobLooping"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Task Conversion Process"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Pass Inputs Directly to a Child Job (Basic Example)"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Parent Workflow"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Create the Child Workflow"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Replace forEach with childJob"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Set the Loop Type"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Convert Array to Object"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Run Workflow"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Use Transformations to Pass Inputs to a Child Job (Advanced Example)"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Restore Parent Workflow"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Create a JST"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Set the Outgoing Schema"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Input for the childJob Task"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Output for the childJob Task"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Related Resources"}], "code_blocks": ["[{\"message\":1},{\"message\":2},{\"message\":3}"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/archiving-purging-best-practice", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/compliance-remediation-best-practices"]}

Moreover, it is an instantiation of an Integration Model whereby the Integration uses specific properties from the Model to connect with specific systems. From Admin Essentials, the user interactions for creating and configuring Integrations occur primarily through the dialog views for\nIntegrations\nand\nIntegration Models\n, respectively. Please note that available views, features, and interactions in the UI can be limited based on user permissions.\nSee related page\n‚ûü\nIntegration Models\nCreating Integrations Using Integration Models\nTo create an integration, click the plus (+) sign in the top-left toolbar of Admin Essentials to open the\nCreate\ndialog. Alternately, from the Integration Model details view, you can click the\n+ Integration\nbutton.\nSelect the appropriate\nIntegration Model\nand click the\nSave\nbutton. You will be redirected to another dialog where you select the appropriate\nIntegration Model\nto create and configure your Integration.\nFigure 1: Create Integration\nFigure 2: New Integration from Integration Model\nConfiguring Integration Properties\nFrom the details view, if your integration has properties to edit, they will be displayed here in a form under the\nConfiguration\ntab. If not, properties can be configured and edited in the\nAdvanced View\n(if the user has been granted permission through the generic\nIntegrations - updateIntegration\nmethod). The\nAdvanced View\neditor is enabled (displayed) by using the toggle switch in the upper-right corner.\nFigure 3: Integration Properties\nFrom the\nAdvanced\nview, the\nMore\nbutton (stacked dots icon) next to the toggle switch can be used to clone or delete an integration if the user has been granted permission. Authorization to clone an integration is set with the\nIntegrations - createIntegration\npermission method. To delete, the\nIntegrations - deleteIntegration\nmethod is used.\nFigure 4: Advanced Configuration View\nSSL Configuration for Integrations\nItential has created two SSL configuration properties for Integrations:\nenabled\nand\nrejectUnauthorized\n. These properties are used when making integration requests to a service even if it has an invalid TLS certificate.\nProperty Schema\n\"tls\":{\n   \"enabled\":false,\n   \"rejectUnauthorized\":false\n}\nThe schema allows an integration instance to have configurable TLS properties to enable/disable the\nrejectUnauthorized\nproperty. This will allow users to bypass HTTPS TLS certificate checks.\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\nenabled\nBoolean\nFalse\nEnables certificate request from endpoint and verify retrieved certificate.\nrejectUnauthorized\nBoolean\nFalse\nIf true, the request will reject a connection that is not authorized with valid CAs. This option only has an effect if \"enabled\" is on.\nIntegration Logging\nLog Levels are controlled by configurations within Admin Essentials. Increasing the size of the log level under the\nLogging\ntab will impact\nall of Itential Platform\n, not just Integrations.\nMoreover, if the Syslog properties are not configured in the Advanced View of the Integration, the user will be unable to change that property in the Logging tab.\nRelated Reading:\nEvent Logs & Logging\nItential Developers: Log Class\nIntegration Responses\nWhenever an integration makes a call, and that call fails to connect to an external system, the information that's necessary for troubleshooting the failed integration task is now viewable by Itential Platform users, including the:\nMethod and action (GET, POST, PATCH, etc)\nURL (protocol, host, basepath, path)\nResponse object (status code, body)\nDebugging information\nThis feature enhancement applies to both on-premises and cloud Itential Platform users to ensure they receive the diagnostic information that's needed for troubleshooting when an integration call fails.\nOutput Errors\nWhen an Integration task is not successful in its call to an external system, an output error is returned along with useful information to help troubleshoot the error that is presented.\nWhen the Integration task fails because it does not have the proper information to make the API call, it will output the error as a\nstring\n, with a message to indicate why it could not make the API call.\nWhen the Integration task fails because the API call was processed by the target server and returned a failure, it will output the error as an\nobject\nwith fields in its response body.\nResponse Body\nItential has standardized the response body of an Integration task with additional information to help understand why an output error was returned.\nResponse Field\nDescription\nok\nBoolean value stating whether the response was successful.\nmethod\nHTTP verb that indicates the type of call, e.g.,\n\"method\": \"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"PATCH\", \"DELETE\"\nurl\nThe URL of the call that failed, e.g.,\n\"url\": \"https://server.com/api/v1/some/resource\"\nstatus\nThe HTTP status code returned by the server.\nstatusText\nDescription of the HTTP status code.\nheaders\nAn array of response headers of the call.\nbody\nThe body of the response.

This may result in an error whereby the Integration task was a\n\"GET\"\nbut the error object was induced by a\n\"POST\"\nto\n\"api/v1/token\"\n. In this scenario, because the token request failed, the Integration could not even attempt the API call, which is why an error object is returned.\nExample: Success Response Body\nA\nSuccessful\nsample response body is presented below.\n{\n  \"ok\": true,\n  \"method\": \"GET\",\n  \"url\": \"http://localhost:8088/pet/7119\",\n  \"status\": 200,\n  \"statusText\": \"OK\",\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"connection\": \"close\",\n    \"content-type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"date\": [\n      \"Fri\",\n      \"05 May 2023 17:48:43 GMT\"\n    ],\n    \"transfer-encoding\": \"chunked\",\n    \"x-powered-by\": \"Express\"\n  },\n  \"body\": {\n    \"id\": 7119,\n    \"tags\": [],\n    \"status\": \"available\",\n    \"name\": \"Lotus\",\n    \"photoUrls\": [\n      \"https://patchpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatIsanAmericanBlackLab.jpg.webp\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\nExample: Error Response Body\nA sample\nError\nresponse body is presented below.\n{\n  \"ok\": false,\n  \"url\": \"https://petstore.swagger.io/api/v3/store/invenxxxtory\",\n  \"status\": 404,\n  \"statusText\": \"Not Found\",\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"access-control-allow-headers\": [\n      \"Content-Type\",\n      \"api_key\",\n      \"Authorization\"\n    ],\n    \"access-control-allow-methods\": [\n      \"GET\",\n      \"POST\",\n      \"DELETE\",\n      \"PUT\"\n    ],\n    \"access-control-allow-origin\": \"*\",\n    \"cache-control\": \"must-revalidate,no-cache,no-store\",\n    \"connection\": \"keep-alive\",\n    \"content-length\": \"309\",\n    \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\",\n    \"date\": [\n      \"Wed\",\n      \"26 Feb 2025 14:02:35 GMT\"\n    ],\n    \"server\": \"Jetty(9.2.9.v20150224)\"\n  },\n  \"text\": \"<html>\\n<head>\\n<meta http-equiv=\\\"Content-Type\\\" content=\\\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\\\"/>\\n<title>Error 404 Not Found</title>\\n</head>\\n<body><h2>HTTP ERROR 404</h2>\\n<p>Problem accessing /api/v3/store/invenxxxtory.

This architecture is the recommended architecture for production environments and testing environments. The Itential Platform application performs many reads and writes against the database and is sensitive to great latencies.  All components must be installed in the same data center.  All components must have authentication enabled.\nThe minimum\nHA2 architecture\nis comprised of 9 VMs broken down as follows:\n2 Itential Platform servers\n3 MongoDB servers\n3 Redis servers\n1 IAG server (Optional)\nHighly Available Itential Enterprise (Itential Platform)\nItential Platform instances communicate with one another through Redis and share data via MongoDB. Simply adding a new Itential Platform node and pointing it to the correct MongoDB and Redis is sufficient to achieve high availability. As Itential Platforms are added and configured they are enabled to perform work.\nItential Platforms must have the following configurations:\nMongoDB connection strings must contain a reference to all members of the replica set.\nRedis configurations must specify the list of all known Redis Sentinels and their Sentinel username and password. Connections to an HA Redis actually occur through the Sentinels and not directly to Redis.\nHighly Available MongoDB\nMongoDB clusters operate in a primary/secondary model where data written to the primary will replicate to the secondary. If a primary MongoDB node fails, the replica set will detect this failure and force an election for a new primary. During this time the replica set may not accept reads and writes until the new primary is selected, usually after a few seconds. Once it is finished and a new primary is identified, the Itential Platform application will resume normal operation. Operators of Itential do not have to do anything during this election.\nItential‚Äôs MongoDB cluster must have the following requirements:\nAll replica set members must be defined in the Itential Platform config.\nAuthentication between the replica members must be done with either a shared key or X.509 certificate.\nThe database must have an admin user able to perform any operation.\nThe database must have an ‚Äúitential‚Äù user that is granted the least amount of privileges required by the Itential Platform application. Itential Platform must be configured to use this user account.\nÔÅö\nMore MongoDB Replication information here ‚Üí\nHighly Available Redis\nRedis clusters operate in a primary/secondary model where data written to the primary will replicate to the secondary.

A list of the supported services can be found at the\nNodemailer\nsite.\nIf you want to receive emails and start a job from an email, an\nIMAP\nconection to the email server is required.\nExample Configurations\nThe Email adapter can be configured using\nNodemailer\nor by using a\nhost\nname and\nport\nnumber. Two examples are presented below.\nExample 1\nIn this example,\nOutlook365\nis the service provider being used in the configuration.\n{\n    \"id\": \"email\",\n    \"type\": \"Email\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"service\": \"Outlook365\",\n      \"auth\": {\n        \"user\": \"username\",\n        \"pass\": \"password\"\n      },\n      \"secure\": false\n    },\n    \"brokers\": [\n      \"notification\"\n    ],\n    \"groups\": []\n  }\nExample 2\nIn this example, the\nhost\nname is configured for\noutlook.office365.com\nand the\nport\nnumber is\n993\n. A service provider is not used.\n\"id\": \"email\",\n    \"type\": \"Email\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"host\": \"outlook.office365.com\",\n      \"port\": 993,\n      \"auth\": {\n        \"user\": \"username\",\n        \"pass\": \"password\"\n      },\n      \"secure\": false\n    },\n    \"brokers\": [\n      \"notification\"\n    ],\n    \"groups\": []\n  }\nSending Attachments\nYou can add attachments to an email message.

See warning below.\n‚ö†\nWarning:\nReferring to a feature release version of Itential Platform (e.g.,\n<bundle_name>:6.0.0\n) will result in the latest maintenance build of that version being run. Itential recommends using a specific maintenance release version (e.g.,\n<bundle_name>:6.0.2\n) in production environments.\nStarting an Itential Platform Container\nTo start an Itential Platform container, issue the following command:\ndocker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3443:3443 \\\n    -e ITENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=\"encryption_key\" \\\n    497639811223.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/<bundle_name>:<tag>\nEnvironment Variables\nItential Platform configuration, including profile properties and service config properties can be set using environment variables starting in Platform 6.\nFor a list of environment variables in Itential Platform, see\nPlatform Environment Variables\n.\nTo set an environment variable, use the\n-e\nflag of the\ndocker run\ncommand. For example:\ndocker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3443:3443 \\\n  -e ITENTIAL_SERVER_ID=\"server1\" \\\n  -e ITENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=\"encryption_key\" \\\n  497639811223.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/<bundle_name>:<tag>\nEncryption Keys\nStarting in Platform 6, an encryption key is required to start the Itential Platform. For information on how to generate an encryption key, see\nCreate the Encryption Key\n.\nOnce a key is generated, you can start the container with the newly created encryption key by passing in the\nITENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY\nenvironment variable. For example:\ndocker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3443:3443 \\\n  -e ITENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=\"encryption_key\" \\\n  497639811223.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/<bundle_name>:<tag>\nEncrypting Values\nTo generate an encrypted value in Platform 6 using containers, run the following command:\ndocker run -it --entrypoint node 497639811223.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/automation-platform-<bundle_name>:<tag> /opt/itential/platform/server/utils/encrypt.js <password_value> <encryption_key>\n...in which\n<password_value>\nis the plaintext password to be encrypted.\nCommon Configuration Tasks\nThe following changes are common in production environments.\nMounting Itential Platform Logs to the Host OS\nBy default, any logs stored by Itential Platform containers are lost when the containers and their volumes are removed. To ensure log persistence:\nCreate a mount directory on the host OS (the OS that your container daemon is running on). This is where the logs are stored. The default\nlog_directory\nwithin the container is\n/var/log/itential/platform\n, but this can be modified via configuration.\nmkdir -p ./itential/platform/logs\nUse a bind mount to mount the directory into your Itential Platform container.\ndocker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3443:3443 \\\\\n  -e ITENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=\"encryption_key\" \\\\\n  --mount type=bind,source=./itential/platform/logs,target=/var/log/itential/platform \\\\\n  497639811223.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/<bundle_name>:<tag>\nAdding SSH Keys and Certificates to Itential Platform\nTo add custom SSH keys and certificates to Itential Platform:\nCreate a mount directory on the host OS (the OS that your container daemon is running on). Place any SSH keys and certificates you would like to add to Itential Platform here.\nmkdir -p ./itential/platform/keys\nEnsure all SSH keys and certificates have the proper permissions.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-adapters-custom-apps", "title": "Adapters & Custom Applications", "text": "Adapters & Custom Applications\nUpdated on\nJun 11, 2025\nPublished on Feb 26, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nThis guide provides Itential users with instructions on how to install Adapters and Custom Applications on Itential Platform 6 when:\nUpgrading from a historical version of the Platform software, which requires you to migrate adapters or custom apps to the appropriate folder.\nPerforming a fresh install of Platform 6, which requires you to be aware of the appropriate installation procedures for Adapters and Custom Applications in the new version of the Platform.\nBefore proceeding, here's a few noteworthy differences to be aware of:\nAlongside the change to RPM for deployment, Itential Platform 6 installs to a different location on-disk than the legacy Platform release versions (22.1/23.1/23.2).\nFor the product to function, it's important to make note of the appropriate location for adapters and custom applications in Platform 6. The installation destination (folder) differs between Platform 6 and the Itential Platform releases (22.1/23.1/23.2).\nMigration to Platform 6\nTo migrate, move and copy adapters from your current (legacy) Itential Platform version to the new Platform 6 release:\nLocate adapters on your current Itential Platform system.\n/opt/itential/pronghorn/node_modules/@ itentialopensource\nGo into an individual adapter.\ncd adapter-name\nRemove the\nnode_modules\ndirectory.\nrm -rf node_modules\nRemove the\npackage-lock.json\n.\nrm package-lock.json\nChange directory out of the adapter.\ncd ..\nPackage and compress the adapter you are working on (\nzip\n,\ngzip\n,\ntar\n).\nMove the compressed adapter to the new Platform 6 system.\nChange adapter directory to the Platform 6 Services directory.\n/opt/itential/platform/services\nDecompress the compressed file into the adapter directory. The services directory should contain the individual adapters and not a namespace.\nRepeat steps 1-9 for all adapters on the current Itential Platform, including any custom adapters that are located in a custom namespace.\nFollow steps 3 and 4 in the adapter installation section below for each adapter.\nWhen you have migrated all of your adapters to Platform 6, follow steps 5-9 of the install below. This is so you will only need to restart the platform once after all adapters have been migrated.\nInstallation\nTo install an adapter:\nGo to the Itential Platform Services directory:\ncd /opt/itential/platform/services\nClone, unzip, or tar the adapter into your Itential Platform environment. Use one of the methods below:\ngit clone git@gitlab.com:@itentialopensource/adapters/adapter-name\nunzip adapter-name.zip\ntar -xvf adapter-name.tar\nInstall the adapter dependencies:\ncd adapter-name\nnpm install\nLint and test the adapter:\nnpm run lint:errors\n- There should be none.\nnpm run test\n- All tests should pass.\nRestart the Itential Platform.\nRun the following to confirm restart:\nsystemctl restart itential-platform\nCreate an adapter service instance in the Itential Platform Admin Essentials GUI.\nConfigure a service instance configuration for the adapter in the Itential Platform Admin Essentials GUI.\nCopy the properties from the\nsampleProperties.json\nin the adapter directory and place into the inner (second) properties in the Admin Essentials Service Instance Configuration for the adapter.\nMake all specific changes such as\nhost\n,\nport\n, authentication method, credentials, etc.\nSet the\nadmin\npermission role to the adapter for anyone:\nBuilding workflows containing an adapter task.\nUsing calls into the adapter for retrieving dynamic data in a JSON form, or within other custom applications.\nUsage\nOnce the adapter has been installed, configured, and permissions set to the appropriate role, the adapter and its tasks should be available to users of the Itential Platform. Moreover, adapters are flexible with a high degree of customization for a variety of needs and use cases:\nYou can add tasks to a workflow in Automation Studio and then run that workflow.\nYou can add dynamic dropdowns that retrieve the list of data from an adapter.\nYou can integrate the adapter with the Device Broker, which will add devices to Configuration Manager.\nYou can access the adapter methods from your custom applications.\nYou can access the adapter methods through Itential Platform API calls.\nLimitations & Workarounds\nA call must exist in the adapter in order to be available. As vendors update APIs, the calls may be missing from adapters. When this occurs, you can use the generic adapter tasks to prevent being blocked while a call is added.\nAlmost all open source adapters come with generic adapter calls that allow you to define endpoints and parameters. These calls can be used when a call is missing from an adapter, or when call parameters have changed. It further allows you to make progress on your use cases while the adapter is being updated to support the additions.\nFurther adapter documentation can be found in the Itential Opensoure library space:\nAdapters\n.\nLogging\nAdapter debug logs are essential to triage adapter issues. The debug logging that's been enabled includes: OPTIONS, REQUEST and CALL RETURN.\nLog\nDescription\nOPTIONS\nThis logs out most of the information for the call made to the downstream system.\nREQUEST\nThis logs out the payload for the request to the downstream system.\nCALL RETURN\nThis is the raw data that the adapter got back from the downstream system.\nTesting\nOnce the adapter has been installed:\nBuild and run a workflow with some simple calls.\nCreate a JSON form and add a dynamic dropdown that utilizes an adapter call.\nFor device broker integration:\nEnsure the system has devices (e.g., Meraki) and there's access to the system.\nGo to the Admin Essentials GUI to verify broker integration for the adapter through the service instance configuration.\nGo to Configuration Manager to see if it was able to discover the devices in the down stream system. If not, you may need to confirm the device broker mappings in the adapter.\nTroubleshooting & Support\nTypical adapter issues center around configuration and authentication. The adapter\nsampleProperties\nshould have authentication techniques that were previously used or were documented to work with the adapter. In addition, every open source adapter should have an\nAUTH.md\nfile that describes the login process and criteria.\nWhen using SSL/TLS, you will need to enable SSL in the adapter service instance configuration. This also requires you to provide a\nca\nfile or to turn on\naccept invalid certs\n. The latter is not recommended for production, but is generally acceptable for development and testing.\nIf you experience any problems or can‚Äôt figure out how to make a change, please contact the Itential Adapters Team using this link:\nHere to Help\nTechnical Resources\nAdapter Configurations and Customizations\nGeneric Adapter Methods\nUsing Adapter API in JSON Form Dropdowns\nRelated Reading\nPlatform 6\nConfiguration Enhancements\nInstallation\nUpgrade\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Adapters & Custom Applications"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Migration to Platform 6"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Installation"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Usage"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Limitations & Workarounds"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Logging"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Testing"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Troubleshooting & Support"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Related Reading"}], "code_blocks": ["/opt/itential/pronghorn/node_modules/@ itentialopensource", "/opt/itential/pronghorn/node_modules/@ itentialopensource", "/opt/itential/platform/services", "/opt/itential/platform/services", "cd /opt/itential/platform/services", "git clone git@gitlab.com:@itentialopensource/adapters/adapter-name", "unzip adapter-name.zip", "tar -xvf adapter-name.tar", "systemctl restart itential-platform", "sampleProperties.json"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-upgrade", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/installing-itential-legacy-platform-versions", "https://docs.itential.com/opensource/docs/adapters", "https://docs.itential.com/opensource/docs/here-to-help", "https://docs.itential.com/opensource/docs/itential-technical-resources", "https://docs.itential.com/opensource/docs/adapter-generic-methods", "https://docs.itential.com/opensource/docs/using-adapters-api-in-json-form-dropdowns", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-configuration-enhancements", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-install", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-upgrade"]}

A natural part of this is to shift our developer focus toward features and enhancements that utilize newer technologies to ensure all our products are cutting edge. However, we recognize that not all of our customers have the ability to update their Itential Platform environments at the same cadence as our release cycle. To accommodate these requirements, Itential provides\nExtended Support (ES)\nand\nStandard Term Support (STS)\nversions of Itential Platform.\nExtended Support (ES)\nFormerly referred as \"LTS\", long term support\nExtended Support will provide customers the option of a Platform version with a three year support period.

Maintenance releases will only include bug fixes and security updates whose inclusion is dependent on the current stage in the ES product release and support cycle (see above).\nStandard Term Support (STS)\nStandard Term Support (STS) provides customers with the ability to integrate new features more quickly into their environments due to the standard six month planned release cycle of major Platform versions. Release and support phases for STS versions are provided in the table below.\nSTS Period\nSTS Phase\nDuration\nCustomer Commitments\n1\nProduct Release and Monthly Maintenance Releases\n12 Months\nWhile the product release is in this phase, it will receive monthly maintenance releases for bug fixes.

While that release is still active in a customer‚Äôs environment, the feature that is marked as deprecated will still be available. No backports or bug fixes will introduce deprecations to an existing release.\nBreaking Changes\nBreaking changes can be introduced with the introduction of any release, including an ES release. No backports or bug fixes will introduce breaking changes to an existing release.\nEnd of Maintenance & Support\nAfter two years for STS, or three years for ES, a major Platform software version will reach its End-of-Support (EOS) date. Once the software reaches EOS, Itential will no longer accept support tickets related to the version, and Maintenance Releases for the version will cease to be published.\nItential Platform\nRelease Version\nSupport Model\nRelease Date\nEnd of Maintenance\nEnd of Support\nPlatform 6\nES\nFeb 27, 2025\nAug 27, 2027\nFeb 27, 2028\n2023.2\nSTS\nMay 2, 2024\nNov 2, 2025\nMay 2, 2026\n2023.1\nSTS\nMay 19, 2023\nApril 19, 2025\nAug 19, 2025\n2022.1\nES\nSep 01, 2022\nAug 1, 2025\nFeb 1, 2026\n2021.2\n-\nJan 24, 2022\nJuly 24, 2023\nJan 24, 2024\n2021.1\n-\nJune 25, 2021\nDec 25, 2022\nJune 25, 2023\n2020.2\n-\nJan 5, 2021\nJuly 5, 2022\nJan 5, 2023\nItential Automation Gateway\nTo provide a more streamlined support experience, Itential Automation Gateway (IAG) version lifecycles are aligned with their corresponding Itential Platform (\"Platform\") versions. This alignment ensures that customers have a single End of Support date to track both products when planning upgrades and maintenance schedules. As a result, when a Platform version reaches its End of Support date, the associated IAG version will also reach End of Support on the same date.\nSince IAG versions follow the same lifecycle as Itential Platform, please check Itential's documentation for the exact End of Support date of a particular IAG version.\nBased on the current Platform lifecycle schedule, please note the following End of Support dates for legacy IAG versions:\nRelease Version\nSupport Model\nEnd of Maintenance\nEnd of Support\nIAG/4.x\nES\nAug 27, 2027\nFeb 27, 2028\nIAG/2023.3\nSTS\nNov 2, 2025\nMay 2, 2026\nIAG/2023.2\nSTS\nNov 2, 2025\nMay 2, 2026\nIAG/2023.1\nSTS\nApril 19, 2025\nAug 19, 2025\nIAG/2022.1\nES\nAug 1, 2025\nFeb 1, 2026\nÔÅö\nNotes:\nIAG versions follow the same support phase structure as their corresponding IAP versions as outlined above.\nMaintenance releases for IAG are coordinated with Itential Platform releases to ensure compatibility.\nSee also:\nIAG Compatibility with Itential Platform\nIAG Versioning\nRPM Version Compatibility (Platform 6)\nWe ensure all our latest RPM packages work seamlessly together, so you can confidently install the most recent version of each component without compatibility concerns. Our engineering team tests every maintenance release to guarantee smooth integration across all RPM packages.\nTo get the best performance and latest features, Itential recommends that you always use the most recent version of each RPM. You'll notice that not every package gets updated in each monthly maintenance release - this is intentional and actually a good thing! When an RPM isn't included in a monthly release, it means that package is already optimized and no changes were necessary. The existing version remains the current, supported release.\nSecurity Updates\nTo remediate high-severity security vulnerabilities, Itential may continue releasing security-only maintenance releases until end-of-support for both Itential Platform and IAG versions, even if no other defect fixes are planned for release.\nSoftware Repository Retention\nItential will periodically remove software from the\nItential Software Repository\nif it has reached its End of Support lifecycle.\nThird-Party Integrations\nAll third-party software version compatibility is documented in the\nPlatform Compatibility\nsection of the Release Notes for each release version (\nProduct Notices ‚Üí Release Notes ‚Üí Maintenance Release Version ‚Üí Platform Compatibility\n). To get the most up-to-date requirements for any third-party integration, including open source, first identify the Itential Platform release version you are using and then refer to the respective release note.\nWhen a third-party integration has reached obsolescence on the Itential Platform, it will no longer be actively supported by the Service Desk. For customers with unsupported third party integrations, Itential may provide limited assistance, where possible, but no bug fixes, workarounds or patches will be provided. As such, the end user will need to upgrade to the newest version of the integration in accordance with version compatibility documented in\nRelease Notes\n.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Version Lifecycle"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Extended Support (ES)"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Standard Term Support (STS)"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Monthly Maintenance Releases"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Deprecations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Breaking Changes"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "End of Maintenance & Support"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Itential Platform"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Itential Automation Gateway"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "RPM Version Compatibility (Platform 6)"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Security Updates"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Software Repository Retention"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Third-Party Integrations"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/isd-support-tickets-frequently-asked-questions", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/accessibility-iap", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-dependencies-consolidated#iag-compatibility-with-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-dependencies-consolidated#iag-versioning-practices"]}

So read on!\nNew Release Versioning\nWe are excited to announce the feature launch of our brand new\nItential Platform version, Platform 6.0.0\n! Get ready to experience next level automation and orchestration for network infrastructure that makes it easier to work within Itential Platform.\nÔÅö\nItential has changed the version number scheme for the Itential Platform from date-based versioning to semantic versioning. All future releases of Itential Platform will follow the scheme\nMAJOR.MINOR.MTCE\n.\nMAJOR\n: A change of the major number indicates incompatible API changes.\nMINOR\n: A change of the minor number indicates a release with added functionality and a backwards compatible API.\nMTCE\n: A change of MTCE number indicates a maintenance release that includes bug fixes and minor improvements.\nThis change aligns with Itential's other software products, including IAG 4 and IAG 5, and is in alignment with industry norms.\nFor more information on semantic versioning, please visit\nSemantic Versioning 2.0.0\nThe key objectives behind the launch of\nPlatform 6\nfocus on Security, Support, and Simplification for Itential customers.\nSecurity\n: Itential has reworked the platform‚Äôs backend to align with today‚Äôs cutting-edge technology, resulting in improved Platform performance and enhanced security.\nSupport\n: Customers can now more easily self-service their use cases with a robust\nIntegrations\nengine that offers expanded authorization and authentication support while providing detailed responses to assist in troubleshooting broken integrations.\nLCM\nhas also been enhanced to offer an audit trail, showing customers how information has changed over time within an instance.\nSimplification\n: Enhancements to\nProjects\nempower users by alerting users to missing, corrupted, or altered references within their destination environments. Additionally, Projects has been simplified with a robust reference management system supporting the intelligent remapping of child jobs, transformations, forms, and other assets when moving, copying, or renaming projects and their components. Platform Installation and Startup has also been simplified with the platform now supporting the RPM Package Management System and simplified configuration. The RPM package manager brings management of Itential dependencies (Python and Node) to the installation process (excludes Redis and Mongo), and removes the requirement for pre-startup configuration scripts. Platform configuration has been expanded to support configuration via Environmental Variables, on-disk data configuration file, or database.\nFeatured Improvements\nThe following provides an overview of the features offered to customers as part of Itential Platform 6:\nIntegrations\nThe next generation of Integrations in Platform 6 expands authentication support, enabling customers to transition from Adapters to Integrations with fewer demands on system resources.\nExpanded support for global headers and parameters, with the ability to define query parameters, headers, and cookies across the Integrations.\nAbility to directly connect with external systems with additional OpenAPI 3.1 authentication and authorization, including support for Mutual TLS, OAuth2.0 Grant Flows, and OpenID Connect.\nDynamic API Keys to improve the security of asset retrieval.\nImproved UI/UX with more detailed information provided within Integration responses to support troubleshooting.\nSimplified integration responses to ensure the information that customers need is easier to locate, and the return payload size is kept to a minimum.\nLifecycle Manager\nLifecycle Manager (LCM) in Platform 6 enables customers to efficiently automate and manage large numbers of LCM instances.\nCustomers can fully automate the creation, management, and deletion of LCM instances, reducing manual work and complexity.\nWith Instance Groups, customers can perform actions against multiple instances at the same time, removing the limitation of addressing each instance separately.\nCustomers now have the ability to track changing properties within instances and the flow of instance data across time.\nBy integrating LCM with Operations Manager, customers can now set triggers for Lifecycle Resource Models and actions.\nProjects\nPlatform 6 brings intuitive and intelligent reference management when importing assets into Projects, with better understanding to what a Project is referencing, especially between environments.\nWith automatic discovery and remapping of references, manual rework has been eliminated. Customers can automatically discover and import all references from an imported asset, ensuring they have transparency into the function of a project.\nUpon import to a new environment, all external project references are validated within the new system. This ensures reference consistency across environments and prevents unexpected behavior during project promotion.\nCore Enhancements\nItential has made major improvements to the Platform Core, with further enhancements to Platform security, reliability and performance.\nImplemented HashiCorp AppRole methods to support authentication between Itential Platform and HashiCorp Vault.\nRemoved Angular to enhance Itential Platform stability, performance, and security.\nImplemented user defined encryption keys and key rotation to enhance user security.\nImplemented new Device Counts within Admin Essentials to easily see how many devices are connected to Itential Platform.\nAdded new\nServer.apiread\nor\nServer.admin\nuser roles to access the advanced Configuration view (service config editor) inside Admin Essentials.\nPlatform Infrastructure\nTo deliver a higher quality software, Itential has improved how we build, test, and distribute Itential Platform.\nExpanded suite of automated testing.\nIncreased automation to reduce the manual process required to build Itential Platform while ensuring compatibility against supported operating systems (AL23, Rocky 8/9, RHEL 8/9).\nImproved artifact distribution with customer access to RPM files and Container Images.\nImproved customer access control to artifact distribution with token-based authentication.\nEnhanced auditing and tracking in artifact distribution that provides Itential visibility into artifact usage and downloads.\nStartup & Configuration\nTo simplify the experience of installing, configuring and completing a first-time-run of Itential Platform, the number of steps to configure and startup have been reduced. Customers can essentially configure once and deploy to multiple locations, and update more frequently with less downtime.\nConsolidated the information required for Itential Platform startup into a single location properties file.\nEnabled the ability to configure Itential Platform entirely through environmental variables.\nImplemented default values. Itential Platform will insert intelligent default values if customers do not fully configure their system.\nEnabled user setup in Itential Platform with a default user, even if an AAA adapter is not configured or installed.\nEnhanced the first time run experience by enabling the configuration of Itential Platform and local AAA via UI.\nEnhanced native support and usability of containerized and virtualized environments.\nCustomers can now select the deployment method that suits their infrastructure needs. Itential Platform will be distributed via RPM files and Container Images.\nMajor Deprecations\nDeprecations and removals in Platform 6 are listed below. Please follow the guidance that's provided to maintain Itential Platform's functionality and performance.\nRemoved\nRequired Action\nAngularJS Support\nCustomer applications utilizing AngularJS must be refactored to either self-host Angular or utilize React.\nAutomation Catalog\nUsers must migrate Automation Catalog automations to Operations Manager prior to upgrading.\nLegacy Forms (application)\nCustomers may contact Itential Customer Success to obtain a side-loaded version of the application.\nService Catalog & Service Catalog Builder\nUsers must migrate Service Catalog automations to Operations Manager.\n‚ö†\nIMPORTANT\nPlease review all Product Notices to ensure you are well informed of any\nDeprecations\nassociated with the Platform 6 release, and be sure to pay particular attention to the detail within the\nBreaking Changes\n.\nAdditional technical detail and product changes to Itential Platform are available in\nPlatform 6 Release Notes\n.\nProduct Showcase\nBe sure to check out this product brief:\nPlatform 6.0\nAnd check out our webinar on the latest updates in this feature release!\nItential Resources\nTo discover more about Itential Platform, be sure to visit:\nItential.com\nItential's Developer Tools\nItential's YouTube Channel\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Platform 6"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "New Release Versioning"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Featured Improvements"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Integrations"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Lifecycle Manager"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Projects"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Core Enhancements"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Platform Infrastructure"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Startup & Configuration"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Major Deprecations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Product Showcase"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Itential Resources"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-feature-release-announcements", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/about-this-release-itential-platform-2023-2", "https://docs.itential.com/v1/docs/about-itential-platform-6-feature-release#product-showcase", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-deprecations", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-breaking-changes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-feature-release-notes"]}

In this example, we would search for:\ndb.getCollection('service_configs').find({\"model\" : \"@itential/app-number\"})\nOnce you find the service config document, right-click and delete the document.\nAdmin Group Not in Proper Format\nWhen assigning roles to user groups the GUI is not correctly reflecting the selected roles as \"checked\". An error box appears at the bottom of the screen.\nUpon inspecting the console, an error message displays.\nAfter running the\njournalctl -fu pronghorn\ncommand, the following error returns.\nmessage=[ 'Error in web handler: TypeError: kg._id.equals is not a function' ]\nSolution\nThis issue is caused by the \"admin\" group having an\n_id\nthat is a string, and not an ObjectID. To address the issue, you will need delete this group.\nBefore proceeding, backup the DB using\nmongodump\n. Use a GUI mongo client to run the commands below. Alternatively, you can access the mongo shell with these commands:\nmongo --host localhost --authenticationDatabase <authdb> -u admin -p <password> use pronghorn\ndb.groups.find({name: \"admin\"}).pretty()\nA single document should return matching the admin user. This should reflect 1 record removed.\ndb.groups.remove({name: \"admin\"})\nReturn to the Itential Platform UI and click the\nREFRESH\nbutton to fully refresh the page and reload the page data.\nAt this point the \"admin\" group should no longer be present and you should now be able to use your groups normally.\nJobs (Operations Manager) Not Showing Updates\nThe Jobs UI is not showing any updates after running the upgrade.\nSolution\nThe migration scripts have not ran. Change directory to the migration script database, then run the scripts again.\ncd <PRONGHORN_HOME>\ncd ./current/node_modules/@itential/pronghorn-core/migration_scripts\nnode migratePropertiesToDatabase.js\nDevices Not Visible in Configuration Manager\nThe following error message is seen in the\nConfigurationManager.log\n.\nNo group access for [object Object] for action XXXX on entity of type device\nWhen you look in the\nConfiguration Manager\napp, devices are unavailable.\nSolution\nThe migration scripts have not ran. Change directory to the migration script database, then run the scripts again.\ncd <PRONGHORN_HOME>\ncd ./current/node_modules/@itential/pronghorn-core/migration_scripts\nnode migratePropertiesToDatabase.js\nFailed to Load Schema Warning Message\nBeginning with the 2019.3 release version, Itential Platform included a built-in schema validation system for inputs/outputs to the\npronghorn.json\n. This system will identify invalid schema formats and automatically run a script to convert the schema to the appropriate format.\nIn the majority of cases the script works and makes updating the\npronghorn.json\neasier. However there may be some schema errors the script cannot handle, in which case an error warning will display alerting you to the invalid data and the need for it to be fixed. Once the\npronghorn.json\nis updated, the schema should load.\nThe following are valid types for input and outputs to the pronghorn.json:\n['*', 'enum', 'object', 'string', 'array', 'boolean', 'integer', 'number']\nNotes:\nType\n'enum'\nis not a valid json schema so the type will be set to array\nType\n'*'\nis a valid type, however it should ONLY be used when you really intend for an input/output to be any type. Using this type will limit json validation and could result in errors if bad type is allowed in.\nCommon invalid types include:\njson\n,\njson[]\n,\nstr\n,\nstring[]\nand many other variations.\nExample: Valid pronghorn.json\n\"methods\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"getDevices\",\n    \"summary\": \"Get the list of supported devices from Inventory for the siteId\",\n    \"description\": \"Get all microwave devices for the given siteId defined in inventory, then filter and\nonly return those supported.\",\n    \"roles\": [\n      \"admin\"\n    ],\n    \"route\": {\n      \"path\": \"/:siteId/devices\",\n      \"verb\": \"GET\"\n    },\n    \"input\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"siteId\",\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Site identifier to get equipment for\",\n        \"required\": \"true\",\n        \"in\": \"path\",\n        \"schema\": {\n          \"title\": \"devices\",\n          \"type\": \"object\"\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n   \"output\": {\n         \"name\": \"devices\",\n         \"description\": \"success/failure response object\",\n         \"type\": \"object\",\n         \"schema\": {\n          \"title\": \"devices\",\n          \"type\": \"object\"\n       }\n   },\n   \"task\": true\n},\nSolution\nRun the\nfix-pronghorn_json.js.gz\nscript to fix issues in pronghorn.json.\nDownload the\nscript\nto your folder.\napp-folder_name\nExecute the node command.\nnode fix-pronghorn_json.js pronghorn.json\nPossible responses include:\nResponse\nMessage\nSuccess\npronghorn.json has been updated\nSuccess (no updates required)\nNo methods detected in: pronghorn.json, file skipped\nFailure\npronghorn.json update cancelled due to previous errors\nShould a failure occur, an error should display that provides a hint on how to fix it. Typically invalid JSON or invalid types are the cause; once you have fixed the issue repeat Step 2 (execute node command).\nIf the\npronghorn.json\nupdate is successful, be sure to push the pronghorn.json back to your repository.\nChange directory to the migration script database, then run the migration scripts.\ncd <PRONGHORN_HOME>\ncd ./current/node_modules/@itential/pronghorn-core/migration_scripts\nnode migratePropertiesToDatabase.js\nTask Is Causing Workflow Engine to Stall or Crash\nWhen an upgraded workflow is ran, Workflow Engine (WFE) will either stall or crash when hitting a specific task.\nSolution\nDelete the task and then recreate it.\nError Retrieving Backups, Device Groups, and Golden Configurations\nIn Configuration Manager errors occur when trying to retrieve backups, device groups, or Golden Configurations.\nSolution\nA migration script is needed.\nConfirm MongoDB version is 5.0.\nmongo --version\nRun the migration script in the Configuration Manager folder.\n/node_modules/@itential/app-configuration_manager/migration_scripts\nFor DEV / STAGING environment, execute the node command:\nnode migrate_to_jinja.js dev\nFor PROD environment, execute the node command:\nnode migrate_to_jinja.js\nRestart IAP.\nsudo systemctl restart pronghorn\nTry to retrieve backups, device groups, and Golden Configurations.\nNote: For IAP 2022.1.x and IAP 2023.1.x Only.\nRabbitMQ Not Starting\nRabbitMQ will not start after being upgraded. When investigating the RabbitMQ log file, error messages similar to the following are found:\n[error] <0.237.0> Feature flags: `classic_mirrored_queue_version`: required feature flag not enabled! It must be enabled before upgrading RabbitMQ.\n[error] <0.237.0> Failed to initialize feature flags registry: {disabled_required_feature_flag,\n[error] <0.237.0>                                               classic_mirrored_queue_version}\n[error] <0.237.0>\n[error] <0.237.0> BOOT FAILED\nSolution\nEnable the\nfeature flag\nindicated in the error messages by using the\nrabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag\ncommand. For example, to enable the\nclassic_mirrored_queue_version\nfeature flag, issue the following:\nrabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag classic_mirrored_queue_version\nFor more information about feature flags, refer to the official\nRabbitMQ documentation\n.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Common Upgrade Errors"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Deprecated App Not

We have made several necessary changes to make\nitential_tools\ncompatible with Cisco NSO 6.4 and higher.\nChanges to Itential Tools\nWith NSO version 6.4, several breaking changes were introduced that made\nitential_tools\nno longer compatible. We discovered that it cannot be compiled nor will it function correctly, primarily as a result of\nLog4j\nupdates and deprecated\nNavNode\nmethods.\nLog4j Updates\nIn NSO 6.4, the\nLog4j\nlibrary was upgraded to version 2.24.1, resulting in deprecated methods that were replaced with alternatives. Additionally, the import style changed in\nLog4j 2.24.1\n, which required modifying existing import statements to align with the new structure.\nTo ensure compatibility, we updated the\nitential_tools\ncodebase to support the\nLog4j 2.24.1\nversion.\nNavNode Deprecated Methods\nIn NSO 6.4, the\ngetChanges()\nmethod was deprecated in\nNavNode\nand replaced with alternatives. To ensure compatibility, we made necessary adjustments to\nitential_tools\nto support this change.\nWhat should I do?\nItential has upgraded\nitential_tools\nto align with changes introduced in Cisco NSO 6.4; however, this updated version is compatible\nonly with Cisco NSO 6.4 and higher\n, and is not backward compatible with earlier versions of NSO. Therefore, if you're using NSO 6.4 or later, please use the updated\nitential_tools\npackage available in the software repository.\nSecondly, we have updated the\nadapter-nso\ncodebase to ensure compatibility with both the new\nitential-tools-64\nand the existing\nitential_tools\npackages. To take advantage of this compatibility update, you must use one of the following minimum versions of\nadapter-nso\n:\nItential Release\nAdapter NSO Version\n2023.2\nv7.9.4-2023.2.14 or later\nPlease ensure\nadapter-nso\nuses the appropriate versions to avoid compatibility issues.\nIf you need any additional support using Itential Platform with NSO, or require more information about this breaking change, please reach out to Itential's\nProduct Support Team\nfor assistance.\nRelated Reading\nCisco DevNet Community: NSO 6.4\nNSO 6.4 Docs\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Itential Tools Updated"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Breaking Change Notice"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Changes to Itential Tools"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Log4j Updates"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "NavNode Deprecated Methods"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "What should I do?"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-key-removed-global-config", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/integration-api-routes-removed-breaking-change-2023-2"]}

Examples include setting user roles and permissions, managing tags, and editing profile settings.\nDesign\nContains\nAutomation Studio\nand\nLifecycle Manager\nthat allow you to create workflows, forms, and templates within Itential Platform.\nOperation\nContains\nOperations Manager\nand\nConfiguration Manager\nthat allow you to manage the execution of automations and device configuration templates within Itential Platform.\nLegacy & Custom\nContains legacy and user-created applications.\nTo launch an application from the\nDashboard\n:\nLocate the desired application in the\nside navigation menu\non the left-hand side of the screen.\nSelect the application; you will be redirected to that application in your active browser tab.\nYou can also launch applications from the\nApplication Banner Menu\nby performing the following steps:\nSelect the\nhamburger menu icon\nlocated at the top-right corner of the side navigation menu; the application banner menu will appear.\nHover your cursor over the\nApplications\nentry in the application banner menu; a list of applications will appear.\nSelect the desired application from the list; you will be redirected to that application in your active browser tab.\nProjects\nProjects is a protected design and development space within Itential Platform where users can collaborate on use cases and then quickly develop, test, and publish assets for production-ready environments.\nAdditional product details on how to access and use Projects in the Platform, including project validation and reference management, can be found here:\nProjects\nBookmarks\nIn addition to launching applications, the Dashboard allows you to manage user-defined bookmarks. A bookmark is a link to a uniform resource locator (URL) that is given a name and, optionally, a description. Bookmarks can link to any URL; however, the URL defined in the bookmark does not have to direct the user to a feature within Itential Platform (though it can).\nThe\nBookmarks\narea of the Dashboard is comprised of the following UI elements (labeled in Figure 2):\nLabel\nUI Element\nFunction\n1\nToolbar\nDisplays icons used to perform bookmark management actions. From left to right, these are:\nCreate\n,\nInfo\n,\nSelect All\n, and\nDelete\n.\n2\nSearch Bar\nAllows you to search for bookmarks by name.\n3\nSort By\nControls what order the displayed bookmarks are sorted in.\n4\nBookmark\nA representation of a bookmark.\n5\nBookmark Action Icons\nDisplays icons used to access, edit, or delete the relevant bookmark.\nFigure 2: Bookmarks UI\nCreating a Bookmark\nTo create a bookmark:\nSelect the\nCreate\nicon in the toolbar; the Create Bookmark modal will appear.\nEnter a name and address (URL) for the bookmark and, optionally, define a description for the bookmark.\nSelect the\nCreate\nbutton at the bottom-left corner of the Create Bookmark modal.\n‚ö†\nUse\nfull URLs\nwhen defining bookmark addresses. For example, to create a bookmark to the Itential website, enter\nhttps://www.itential.com\n.\nAccessing Bookmarks\nTo access a bookmark:\nUse the\nSort by\nbutton to specify the desired sorting criteria (optional).\nLocate the desired\nbookmark\n.\nSelect the\nmenu button (stacked dots)\nlocated at the bottom-right corner of the bookmark; the bookmark action icons will appear.\nSelect the\nOpen page here\nicon to be redirected to the bookmark in your active browser tab, or select the\nOpen in new window\nicon to open the bookmark in a new browser tab.\nNote:\nIf you know the name of the desired bookmark, you can find it by using the\nsearch bar\n. Any bookmarks that do not at least partially match the name specified in the search bar will be filtered from display.\nEditing Bookmarks\nTo edit a bookmark:\nSelect the\nmenu button (stacked dots)\nlocated at the bottom-right corner of the bookmark; the bookmark action icons will appear.\nSelect the\nEdit\nicon; the\nUpdate Bookmark\nmodal will appear.\nMake any desired changes to the name, address (URL), and description of the bookmark.\nSelect the\nUpdate\nbutton at the bottom-left corner of the Update Bookmark modal to save and retain your changes.\nDeleting Bookmarks\nBookmarks can be deleted individually or in bulk.\nTo delete an\nindividual\nbookmark:\nSelect the\nmenu button (stacked dots)\nlocated at the bottom-right corner of the bookmark; the bookmark action icons will appear.\nSelect the\nDelete\nicon; a confirmation modal will appear.\nConfirm the deletion of the bookmark by selecting the\nDelete\nbutton at the bottom-left corner of the confirmation modal.\nTo delete bookmarks\nin bulk\n:\nSelect each bookmark to be deleted by ticking the\nselection box\nlocated at the bottom-left corner of the bookmark; a checkmark will appear in the selection box.\nSelect the\nDelete\nicon from the toolbar; a confirmation modal will appear.\nConfirm the deletion of the bookmarks by selecting the\nDelete\nbutton at the bottom-left corner of the confirmation modal.\nExternal Links (Admin)\nExternal links are essentially browser bookmarks - simple links to arbitrary URLs along with a name and optional description. One key difference from a browser bookmark is these external links are globally available. Only an Admin can add/remove them, and they are intended to be used when an Admin wants all users to have the exact same set of links.\nAs an Admin, granting yourself the\nExternalLinks.admin\nrole will allow you to add, edit, and view/open external links. Non-admins can only view/open external links (with the proper permissions). The\nExternalLinks.getLinks\npermission is needed to view/open external links and is available in the\nExternalLinks.apiread\nrole.\nOn the Itential Platform Homepage, click the plus sign (+) icon in\nBookmarks\nto create a new external link. The\nUpdate Bookmark\ndialog will display.\nFigure 3: Bookmarks\nAdmins can add an External Link with a name, address, and description (optional). After creating the bookmark, the link should appear in the\nExternal Link\nwidget, and should open in a new tab when clicked. Admins can also delete and edit links from this widget.\nFigure 4: Update Bookmark\nWhen there are several links, a collection will display as cards with the bookmark name relevant to the link displayed within the card.\nFigure 5: Bookmarks Collection\nOf note, there are differences between the Admin and User view when accessing Itential Platform Bookmarks, namely the buttons to create, edit, and delete will not appear in the User view.\nGetting Help & Support\nSeveral links to support resources, such as user guides and API references, are provided in the\nHelp & Support\nelement of the Dashboard. Upon selecting a link, you will be redirected to the relevant content in a new browser tab.\nNote:\nSupport links are also available in the\napplication banner menu\n. Access the application banner menu by selecting the\nhamburger menu icon\nlocated at the top-right corner of the side navigation menu.\nAdditional resource information for our customers is referenced below.\nResource\nDescription\nResource Library\nAccess the\nResource Library\nfor the latest white papers, e-books, videos, podcasts and more.\nDeveloper Hub\nExplore tools, resources, and open source projects in the\nItential Developer Hub\n.\nItential Support\nContact the\nProduct Support Team\nfor help with specific support issues (production environment).\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Dashboard"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Accessing the Platform"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Supported Browsers"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Third-Party Software Compatibility"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Navigating the Dashboard"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Applications"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Projects"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Bookmarks"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Creating a Bookmark"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Accessing Bookmarks"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Editing Bookmarks"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Deleting Bookmarks"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "External Links (Admin)"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Getting Help & Support"}], "code_blocks": ["https://www.itential.com", "ExternalLinks.getLinks", "ExternalLinks.apiread"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-overview", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-system-search", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-dependencies-consolidated", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/iap-admin-essentials", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/automation-studio-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/lifecycle-manager-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/operations-manager-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/configuration-manager-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/legacy-custom-iap", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/projects"]}
{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/enumerations-in-applications-itential-platform", "title": "Enumerations in Applications", "text": "Enumerations in Applications\nUpdated on\nFeb 20, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nThis guide provides a general explanation of the\nENUM\nfeature, and shows the use of ENUM in the\npronghorn.json\nfile of Itential Platform.\nTerminology and Concepts\nEnum is a short abbreviation for \"enumerations\", which means \"specifically listed\". An enum specifies a list of constant values assigned to a type. A constant is an identifier (name) for a value that cannot change during the execution of a script/command.\nEssentially, enum is a special \"class\" that represents a group of constants. Once an enum is defined in configuration, you can constrain input to the set of values in the enumeration.\nHow and When to Use Enums to Define Workflow Tasks\nEnums are used to represent a fixed number of possible values. Hence, use enum if there is a definite number of fixed values for any one variable (similar to Boolean values with true or false).\nTo create an\nenum\ninput for a task.\n* Use the\nenum\nkeyword as type.\n* Use\nenum\nwhen you have values that are not going to change, such as months, days of the week, colors, shirt sizes, etc.\nCreate an\nenumerals\narray with all valid variations. In the example below, the\nenumerals\narray consists of the elements: sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, and saturday.\nExample\nThe\nWhatDay\ntask.\n\"methods\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"WhatDay\",\n    \"description\": \"Day of the week picker.\",\n    \"summary\": \"Day of the week picker.\",\n    \"deprecated\": false,\n    \"roles\": [\n      \"admin\"\n    ],\n    \"input\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"theDay\",\n        \"type\": \"enum\",\n        \"enumerals\": [\"sunday\", \"monday\", \"tuesday\", \"wednesday\", \"thursday\", \"friday\", \"saturday\"],\n        \"description\": \"Pick a day of the week.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"output\": {\n      \"name\": \"hoursDaylight\",\n      \"description\": \"The numerical value of how many hours of daylight the selected day has.\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"task\": true\n  }\n]\nNote: You can create enumeration values that can be selected when filling a user input field. You can lock enum values to ensure that only the values you have created are selected for user input.\nEnumeration in Workflow Builder\nOnce a task is created:\nNavigate to Workflow Builder.\nAdd the task to the canvas, e.g., the\nWhatDay\ntask example.\nFigure 1: What Day Task\nDouble-click to configure the task.\nChange the field type from\njob\nto\nstatic\n. Notice the pre-populated drop down list containing the days of the week.\nItential Application Schema\nThe following JSON schema can be used as reference for building valid\npronghorn.json\nfiles.

The latest compatibility version for MongoDB is documented on the\nItential Dependencies\npage.\nNote Regarding MongoDB 6.x\nItential Platform uses version 3.7 of the MongoDB Node.js driver to interact with MongoDB. This version of the driver is compatible with MongoDB versions 5.x and 6.x; however, it does not support all features of version 6.x. and no new features introduced in MongoDB version 6.x are used by Itential Platform.\nItential Platform uses the MongoDB Driver and we will fully support any issue that occurs as it relates to Itential Platform; however, it is not Itential's responsibility to provide support beyond the capabilities of our software.\nFor more compatibility information about the MongoDB Node.js driver, refer to the\nMongoDB documentation\n.\nUpgrading MongoDB\nSee the official\nMongoDB\ninstall documentation for\nRed Hat\n.\nTo upgrade MongoDB, run the following command in the the\nmongo\nshell.\ndb.adminCommand(\n     { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: \"5.0\" }\n)\nInstalling MongoDB\nUse the following recommendations for installing MongoDB in your production environment. These recommendations are relevant where MongoDB is running in a virtual machine; however, many of these configurations can also apply to bare metal installs.\nPackages to Install on RHEL\nnumactl\ntuned\ntuned-utils\nxfsprogs\n(if the recommended XFS file system is being used)\nStorage and File System Recommendations\nUse XFS file system.\nSample storage layout to enable backup and recovery mechanisms.\nDedicate 10% of the volume to enable file system level snapshots.\nDedicate 90% of the volume for the data directory.\nIf using a 500 GB volume.\n50 GB for snapshots.\n450 GB for data.\nDisable access time writes by adding the\nnoatime\nand\nnodiratime\nflags to the\nfstab\n.\nFor example:\n/dev/mapper/rhel-data /data xfs noatime,nodiratime 0 0\nNote:\nYou may need to verify the network settings in your\nmongod.conf\nfile. This file is set to 127.0.0.1 but may need to be changed to 0.0.0.0. For more information on adapting the config settings for this file, refer to the\nMongoDB¬†documentation\n.\nRead Concerns/Write Concerns\nTo configure the default values for\nreadConcern\nand\nwriteConcern\noperations in MongoDB, refer to\nMongoDB Read Concern/Write Concern in Itential Platform\n.\nImportant Kernel Parameters to Tune\nTCP\nkeepalive\ntime should be reduced on both the MongoDB server and MongoDB clients.\nnet.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 300\nZone Reclaim Mode should be disabled.\nvm.zone_reclaim_mode = 0\nIncrease the throughput settings.\nnet.core.somaxconn = 65535\nSoft User Limits\nConfigure soft user limits for the MongoDB database user.

To configure the connection pool when connecting to MongoDB, use the\nmaxPoolSize\nsetting under\nmongoProps\nwithin the properties.json file.\nThis setting can affect performance. When the maximum number of connections is reached, no additional connections can be created (opened) in the connection pool. An incorrectly set value can also result in a performance bottleneck.\nProperty Name\nType\nDefault\nDescription\nmaxPoolSize\nInteger\n100\nA number that represents the maximum number of connections allowed within a connection pool. Valid values range from 1 to 65535.\nSample Connection Pool Configuration\n\"mongoProps\": {\n  \"db\": \"pronghorn\",\n  \"url\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\",\n  \"maxPoolSize\": 100\n}\nFor more information on connection pooling, refer to:\nMongoDB Connection Pool\nConnection Pool Performance Tuning\nConfiguring Itential Platform with MongoDB Replica Sets\nFollow these steps to\nConfigure a MongoDB Replica Set\n.\nWhen MongoDB is configured as a replica set, the properties file should be configured with the host details of each of the MongoDB members. This is done by appending each host into the\nurl\nproperty, including the name of the replica set, which in the example below is\nrs0\n.\nIn the example below, the replica set consists of three members that are configured on servers 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2 and 10.0.0.3, all on port 27017.\nThere is no need to specify the 'Primary' and 'Secondary' members. This is something each MongoDB member will decide via an 'election'.\nRefer to the MongoDB documentation for more information on\nReplica Sets and members elections\n.\nSample Configuration\nBelow is an example\nproperties.json\nconfiguration with a MongoDB replica set.\n{\n\"mongoProps\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"dbAuth\": true,\n      \"user\": \"itentialUser\",\n      \"passwd\": \"itentialPassword\"\n    },\n    \"ssl\": {\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"sslValidate\": true,\n      \"sslCA\": \"./keys/mongodb_ca.cert\",\n      \"acceptInvalidCerts\": false,\n      \"checkServerIdentity\": true\n    },\n    \"db\": \"IP\",\n    \"url\": \"mongodb://10.0.0.1:27017,10.0.0.2:27017,10.0.0.3:27017?replicaSet=rs0\"\n    }\n  }\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "MongoDB"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Upgrading MongoDB"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Installing MongoDB"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Packages to Install on RHEL"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Storage and File System Recommendations"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Read Concerns/Write Concerns"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Important Kernel Parameters to Tune"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Soft User Limits"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Disable Transparent Huge Pages"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Configure Security and Replication"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Connection Pool Size"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Sample Connection Pool Configuration"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Configuring Itential Platform with MongoDB Replica Sets"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Sample Configuration"}], "code_blocks": ["db.adminCommand(\n     { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: \"5.0\" }\n)", "db.adminCommand(\n     { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: \"5.0\" }\n)", "/dev/mapper/rhel-data /data xfs noatime,nodiratime 0 0", "net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 300", "net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 300", "vm.zone_reclaim_mode = 0", "vm.zone_reclaim_mode = 0", "net.core.somaxconn = 65535", "net.core.somaxconn = 65535", "nproc = 32000\nnofile = 64000", "nproc = 32000\nnofile = 64000", "disable-transparent-hugepages", "etc/tuned/no-thp:\n[main]\ninclude=virtual-guest\n[vm]\ntransparent_hugepages=never", "etc/tuned/no-thp:\n[main]\ninclude=virtual-guest\n[vm]\ntransparent_hugepages=never", "tuned-adm profile no-thp", "tuned-adm profile no-thp", "#Where and how to store data.\nstorage:\ndbPath: {{ mongo_data_dir }}\n\n#repairPath: {{ mongo_data_dir }}\njournal:\nenabled: true\nengine: \"wiredTiger\"", "#Where and how to store data.\nstorage:\ndbPath: {{ mongo_data_dir }}\n\n#repairPath: {{ mongo_data_dir }}\njournal:\nenabled: true\nengine: \"wiredTiger\"", "\"mongoProps\": {\n  \"db\": \"pronghorn\",\n  \"url\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\",\n  \"maxPoolSize\": 100\n}", "\"mongoProps\": {\n  \"db\": \"pronghorn\",\n  \"url\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\",\n  \"maxPoolSize\": 100\n}", "{\n\"mongoProps\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"dbAuth\": true,\n      \"user\": \"itentialUser\",\n      \"passwd\": \"itentialPassword\"\n    },\n    \"ssl\": {\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"sslValidate\": true,\n      \"sslCA\": \"./keys/mongodb_ca.cert\",\n      \"acceptInvalidCerts\": false,\n      \"checkServerIdentity\": true\n    },\n    \"db\": \"IP\",\n    \"url\": \"mongodb://10.0.0.1:27017,10.0.0.2:27017,10.0.0.3:27017?replicaSet=rs0\"\n    }\n  }", "{\n\"mongoProps\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"dbAuth\": true,\n      \"user\": \"itentialUser\",\n      \"passwd\": \"itentialPassword\"\n    },\n    \"ssl\": {\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"sslValidate\": true,\n      \"sslCA\": \"./keys/mongodb_ca.cert\",\n      \"acceptInvalidCerts\": false,\n      \"checkServerIdentity\": true\n    },\n    \"db\": \"IP\",\n    \"url\": \"mongodb://10.0.0.1:27017,10.0.0.2:27017,10.0.0.3:27017?replicaSet=rs0\"\n    }\n  }"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/rabbitmq-itential-platform-20221x-20231x", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/template-builder-dependencies-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-dependencies-consolidated", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/compatibility/#std-label-node-compatibility", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/reference/configuration-options/", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/mongodb-readconcern-write-concern-itential-platform", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/tutorial/transparent-huge-pages/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/security/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/replication/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/connection-pool-overview/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/connection-pool-performance-tuning/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/replication/"]}

When an API endpoint associated with an API endpoint trigger receives an\nHTTP POST\nrequest:\nThe body of the\nHTTP POST\nrequest (represented as a JSON object) is validated against the\nPOST body schema\ndefined in the API endpoint trigger.\nIf the body of the\nHTTP POST\nrequest is validated, it is sent to an optional JST defined in the API endpoint trigger.\nAfter the JST is applied (if relevant), the keys and values of the\nHTTP POST\nrequest body are made available to the workflow and the automation is run.\nThe API endpoint that triggered the automation will respond to the client with information about the workflow that was started.\nÔÅö\nNote:\nIf you wish to use keys and values from the body of the\nHTTP POST\nrequest in a workflow, you must reference them as\njob variables\nwithin the workflow itself.\nEach API trigger requires a unique route name. URLs for endpoint triggers use the following format:\n/operations-manager/triggers/endpoint/:routeName\nFigure 4: Create API Endpoint Trigger\nLabel\nUI Element\nFunction\n1\nName\nAdd or change the trigger name.\n2\nDescription\nOptional.

If the\nHTTP POST\nrequest body is validated, the API trigger continues its preparations to run the automation. If the\nHTTP POST\nrequest body is not validated, the automation is\nnot\nrun.\nThe POST body schema uses the following syntax:\n{\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {},\n    \"additionalProperties\": true\n}\nProperty\nDescription\ntype\nRefers to the\nHTTP POST\nrequest body, which is represented as a JSON object.\nproperties\nThis is where the variables the\nHTTP POST\nrequest body should be validated against are defined.\nadditionalProperties\nAllows variables not defined in the\nproperties\nkey of the POST body schema to be present in the\nHTTP POST\nrequest body without affecting validation. Default is\ntrue\n.\nExample\nThe following example outlines how to trigger a\nVelocloud Edge Provisioning Automation\nusing an API Endpoint Trigger.\nCreate API Endpoint Trigger\nCreate an\nAPI Endpoint Trigger\nwith the following:\nEndpoint\n- Use the following endpoint to trigger the automation. As a suggestion, use\nPostman\nto view your data.\nhttps://example.iap-prod.itential.io/operations-manager/triggers/endpoint/velocloud-edge-provisioning-v2\nAuthentication\n‚Äì Itential Platform uses a token for API calls, and the token is passed to the endpoint via the\ntoken\nquery parameter. In on-premises Itential Platform environments, this token can be retrieved by making a call to the\nlogin\nendpoint. Refer to the\nAPI documentation\nfor additional reference. For SaaS customers with Itential Cloud environments, it is provided by the\nProduct Support Team\n.\nhttps://example.iap-prod.itential.io/operations-manager/triggers/endpoint/velocloud-edge-provisioning-v2?token={{IAP-static-token}}\nPayload Body\n‚Äì The values in the payload body are used by the automation for edge provisioning in Velocloud.\n{\n    \"iapPayload\": {\n        \"disableGe3InterfaceWanOverlay\": true,\n        \"vco\": \"vco109-usca1\",\n        \"enterpriseId\": \"935\",\n        \"configurationId\": \"12285\",\n        \"name\": \"sampleEdge\",\n        \"vpcCidr\": \"10.100.100.0/22\",\n        \"publicSubnetCidr\": \"10.100.101.0/24\",\n        \"privateSubnetCidr\": \"10.100.102.0/24\",\n        \"managementIp\": \"10.100.101.10/32\",\n        \"ge3Ip\": \"10.100.101.4/24\",\n        \"terraformPrivateIp\": \"10.100.102.4\",\n        \"availabilityZone\": \"us-west-2c\",\n        \"awsAccessKey\": \"EXAMPLE1A6DYSQ8LXGNV\",\n        \"awsSecretKey\": \"EXAMPLE+O0sVH22k6mwbHddceygaXAdx4St0k/KB\"\n\n    }\n\n}\nPostman Call\n- An example of what the API call looks like in Postman is shown below.\nFigure 5: Data View in Postman\nCheck Automation Status\nUsers will have to make another call to Itential Platform to check on the status of the automation (job). When triggering automations via API, Itential Platform will return a 200-status code if the automation was started successfully.\nGET Call\n- Use the following URL in a\nGET\ncall to check the job status.\nhttps://example.iap-prod.itential.io/operations-manager/jobs/{{job_id}}?token={{IAP-static-token}}&include=status\nFigure 6: Checking the Automation Status\nResponse Body\n- The\njob_id\nvalue can be found in the response body of the POST call (\n_id\n) used to start the automation. See below for an example of this response and where to get the\njob_id\n.\nFigure 7: Locating the Job ID\nResponse Status\n- The response from the\nGET\njob status call should look like the example below. The\n\"status\"\nfield indicates if the job is still running or complete.\n{\n    \"message\": \"Successfully retrieved item\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"_id\": \"847a683ac25a486e99f04fe3\",\n        \"status\": \"complete\"\n    },\n    \"metadata\": {}\n}\n}\nÔÅö\nHTTP Verbs\nOperations Manager API Triggers are intended to cause the start of an automation job. For this reason, the\nonly\nappropriate HTTP verb supported by the application is\nPOST\n. HTTP verbs are used to denote the impact the request has on the target resource. In the case of Operations Manager, the target resource is the referenced API Trigger itself. Supporting other HTTP verbs, such as DELETE, would imply that an API trigger is being deleted rather than implying that the API triggers an automation whose purpose is to delete some configuration from an external service or device.\nAdditional Resource\nFor more information related to API Triggers, watch this\nItential Learn\nvideo on\nHow to Create API Triggers, Define & Map Job Variables\n.\nSchedule Triggers\nSchedule triggers run the automation at some point in the future at an optional repeating frequency.\nÔÅö\nNote:\nThe\nStart\ntime selected in the Create Trigger panel and shown in the trigger card after saving is based on the user's current time and date.\nFigure 8: Create Schedule Trigger\nLabel\nUI Element\nFunction\n1\nName\nAdd or change the trigger name.\n2\nDescription\nOptional.

If the\npayload\nis validated, the event trigger continues its preparations to run the automation. If the\npayload\nis not validated, the automation is\nnot\nrun.\nThe payload schema filter uses the following syntax:\n{\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {},\n    \"additionalProperties\": true\n}\nProperty\nDescription\ntype\nRefers to the\npayload\nkey of the event object, which is itself a JSON object.\nproperties\nThis is where the event variables the\npayload\nshould be validated against are defined.\nadditionalProperties\nAllows variables not defined in the\nproperties\nkey of the payload schema filter to be present in the\npayload\nwithout affecting validation. Default is\ntrue\n.\n‚ö†\nWarning:\nIt is possible to create an infinite job execution loop if an automation can activate its own event trigger. This is especially applicable when using the following events in an event trigger:\njobStart\njobCancel\njobError\nWhen using an event trigger to run an automation, be sure the workflow executed by the automation cannot generate an event that will activate that event trigger.\nTrigger Cards\nYou can also manage the triggers for a current automation through a collection of trigger cards on the\nAutomation Details\npage. In this collection, each automation trigger is represented by a card.\nFigure 10: Trigger Cards\nLabel\nUI Element\nFunction\n1\nTriggers Toolbar\nAction icons (from left to right) to create a new trigger, run a trigger, or delete triggers.\n2\nToggle Switch\nEnables or disables the trigger.\n3\nSelect Trigger\nCheckbox to select the trigger.\n4\nAction Icons\nUsed to perform operations against the trigger.

For more information on how to install an NSO External Authentication script, see the\nNSO Network Adapter Integration guide\n.\nTerminology\nA list of terms related to Itential Platform users, groups, and roles are defined in the following table.\nTerm\nDefinition\nUser\nAn entity that can perform specific actions within multiple Itential Platform applications based on group associations.\nGroup\nA collection of roles that can be assigned to a user.\nRole\nA collection of granular level privileges that can be assigned to groups.\nPermission\nAuthorization granted to an API and a specific page view.\nProvenance\nRefers to the source (origin) of a group. For external groups, this is set to the Itential Platform AAA\nadapterId\n. For Itential Platform groups, it is not set.\nUsers\nA user is an entity that comes from an external AAA System such as LDAP. All operations within Itential Platform are associated with a user. Itential Platform provides the ability to assign roles directly to users. Also, with Itential Platform groups, administrators are able to manage user membership. Users may be a member of any number of groups and through group membership may be assigned any number of roles.\nUser roles, whether directly assigned or inherited from a group, determine what the user can see and do within Itential Platform. The final permission set of a user will be a combination of permissions granted to all the roles assigned to the user, or to any groups in which the user is a member.\nViewing & Filtering Users\nBecause users are accounts from an external system, Itential Platform will create a user record when someone has successfully logged in using the user‚Äôs AAA system credentials.\nTo view the\nAuthorization ‚Üí Users\ntable, you must have permission for the\nauthorization.getAccounts\nmethod. This allows you to access the page, view the list of users, and see their login status.\nThe indicator circles under the\nActive\ncolumn header denote the login status of each user:\n‚óè\nBlue - User is currently logged in.\n‚óè\nRed - User who is deactivated.\n‚óè\nGrey - User who is not logged in.\nÔÅö\nActive Login Session Management was made available in release versions 2023.2 and higher.\nThe ability to view active login sessions is not available in earlier release versions of Itential Platform.\nThe\nUsers\ntable can be filtered by login status using the popover menu in the top-right. Click the vertical ellipsis (\n‚ãÆ\n) to display two filter toggles that:\nShow Active Users Only\n- Only recently active users are shown in the table.\nShow Deactivated Users\n- Only deactivated users are shown in the table.\nFigure 2: User Status Indicators\nConfiguring Role Assignments for Users\nThere are two ways to assign users to\nRoles\n:\nDirectly\nBy groups membership\nTo assign\nRoles\ndirectly to a user:\nLocate the user you wish to assign. Alternately, you can filter the user list by typing in the\nusername\ncolumn header search box.\nAdd or remove role assignments using the checkbox. You can filter the roles list by typing in the\nSearch\nfield.\nClick\nClose\nwhen done.\nÔÅö\nRoles assigned by Groups are grayed out (disabled). This indicates the assignment is inherited.\nFigure 3: User Roles\nConfiguring Group Membership for Users\nExternal group memberships for users are managed by the external AAA system and cannot be edited in Itential Platform. A user may only be added or removed from Itential Platform Groups within Authorization. Addition or removal of AAA groups must be performed in the AAA system and will be noticed by Itential Platform the next time the user logs in.\nTo change the\nGroups\nto which a user belongs:\nClick the\nGroups\ntab option.\nFind the group in the list. You can filter the list by typing in the column header textbox.\nAdd or remove group membership using the checkbox.\nClick\nClose\nwhen done.\nFigure 4: User Groups\nNote:\nÔÅö\nAAA-managed group memberships will be grayed out (disabled), indicating the membership is not editable in Itential Platform.\nForced Logout\nItential allows administrators to forcefully logout all or selected users with from the Authorization interface. Admins must have permission for the\nAuthorization.forceLogout\nmethod.\nClick the checkboxes to select users and then click the\nLog Out\nbutton icon at the top to forcefully log out all selected users.\nFigure 5: Forced Logout\nGroups\nAn Itential Platform\nGroup\nis an account created within the Itential Platform system. Users are assigned to Itential Platform groups through\nAuthorization\n. In contrast, users are assigned to external groups within the external AAA system. Users cannot be assigned to external groups using Itential Platform. An external group is an account that comes from an external AAA System such as LDAP. An external group cannot be created within Itential Platform.\nÔÅö\nIf\nUser1\nis a member of\nGroup1\nand starts a job, and\nUser2\nis not a member of\nGroup1\n, then\nUser2\nwill not be able to see the job.\nAssigning Groups to Roles\nExternal groups cannot be created within Itential Platform. Instead, Itential Platform will create the external group record once it has been learned from the AAA system.\nGroups are assigned to roles in two ways:\nDirectly\nBy membership in another group\nTo assign roles directly to a group in Itential Platform:\nSelect\nAuthorization\n‚Üí\nGroups\nfrom the navbar on the left. A list of defined groups is displayed.\nLocate the group you wish to assign to a role. Alternately, you can filter the user list by typing in the\nName\ncolumn header search box.\nClick the eye icon at the end of the table row to open the\nView Group\ndialog. The\nRoles\ntab displays by default.\nIn the\nEdit Group\nmodal, locate the role you wish to assign.\nFilter the list by typing in the\nName\nor\nSource\nsearch bar.\nAdd or remove a role assignment by selecting the checkbox.\nClick\nClose\nwhen done.\nÔÅö\nRoles which are assigned by other groups are grayed out (disabled). This indicates the assignment is inherited.\nFigure 6: Group Roles\nAssigning Group Membership\nItential Platform groups and external groups can be given membership to an Itential Platform group; however, neither group can be given membership to an external group.\nTo assign group membership:\nSelect\nAuthorization\n‚Üí\nGroups\nfrom the navbar on the left. A list of defined groups is displayed.\nLocate the group in the list. You can filter the list by typing in the\nSearch\nfield.\nSelect the group in the list to view by clicking the eye icon at the end of the table row.\nFrom the\nEdit Group\nmodal, select the\nGroups\ntab .\nAdd or remove group membership by selecting the checkbox.\nClick\nClose\nwhen done.\nIdentifying Group Members\nTo view group members:\nSelect the\nMembers\ntab on the\nEdit Group\nmodal to display the members list of users that are direct members of a group. There is no indicator for inherited memberships.\nLocate the member username in the list. You can filter the list by typing in the\nSearch\nbar.\nClick\nClose\nwhen done.\nRoles\nA role is a bundle of permissions assigned to users and groups, granting permission to access one or more endpoints. Roles are pre-defined in the\npronghorn.json\nfile for each application and assigned to methods and views with the\nroles\nproperty.\nBuilt-In Roles\nThe following list of built-in roles come with Itential Platform, and offer a set of ready-to-use permissions and access levels that pre-define what actions users can perform within the Platform.\nÔÅö\nThese built-in roles can be used a guided framework for users who desire to create custom roles, as needed, for more precise control. Itential Platform offers the flexibility of custom role access based on your organization's security and business needs.\nRole\nDescription\nadmin\nFull permission to Itential Platform to configure and manage access control.\napiread\nProvides view-only access to API information, but does not allow you to make changes.\napiwrite\nProvides access to view API information and make changes.\nauthorization\nProvides access to modify RBAC and control authorization of data.\ndesigner\nGrants access to build workflows and automations within Itential Platform's Lifecycle Manager, Studio, and Operations Manager.\nengineering\nGrants access to perform engineering-related functions to develop, maintain, and troubleshoot custom applications and adapters.\noperations\noperator\nCan create, manage and execute Itential Platform automations and related workflow events.\nsupport\nGrants access to perform support-related tasks on the system environment.\ntaskread\nProvides view-only access to task information, but does not allow you to make changes.\ntaskwrite\nProvides access to view task information and make changes.\nEndpoints\nEndpoints are defined by each application in the Platform. There are essentially two types of endpoints:\nEndpoint\nDescription\nAPI Methods\nRepresent API Endpoints that read or write data.\nUI Views\nRepresent web pages in the browser. A view will typically rely on one or more methods to read/write data.\nSince the Platform comes with several built-in roles that offer a set of ready-to-use permissions and access levels, a role may be assigned to any number of users or groups to provide access to the endpoints granted to that role.\nTo view endpoints granted to a role:\nSelect\nRoles\nfrom the left-side navigation menu. A table list displays. There is a role for each application installed in the system.\nOptionally, type in the search bar to sort/filter by role, application associated with the role, or by description.\nClick the view icon for your desired role to open the\nView Role\nmodal, which shows all the\nAPI Methods\nand\nUI Views\nfor a role. You can sort and filter using the\nMethod\nand\nSource\nfields.\nFigure 7: View Role API Methods\nFigure 8: View Role UI Views\nCustom Roles\nIn addition to built-in roles defined by applications, Itential Platform allows administrators to define custom roles for an installation to allow for different authorization strategies. Built-in roles are hard coded in the services (or in Itential Platform) and are not user-editable. Users can only utilize services from their active server profile, and cannot add roles for services that are currently not running.\nCreating Custom Roles\nUse a unique name when creating a custom role:\nClick the plus (+) sign from the top toolbar in Admin Essentials to open the\nCreate\ndialog.\nSelect\nRole\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nGive the new custom role a name (required).\nGive the new custom role a description (optional).\nSelect the appropriate API endpoints and UI Views in the\nEdit Role\nmodal, and then click\nSave\nto finalize your changes. The custom role appears in the\nAuthorization: Roles\ntable view and will display as\nCustom\nunder the\nType\ncolumn.\nFigure 9: Create Custom Role\nFigure 10: Assign Custom Role API Endpoints and UI Views\nEditing Custom Role Permissions\nTo edit custom role permissions:\nSelect\nRoles\nfrom the menu in the left navbar.\nType the name of the\nCustom\nrole in the search bar under the\nRole\ncolumn header.\nSelect the desired role from the results list.\nClick the stacked dots menu icon and select\nEdit\n. The endpoints for the selected custom role will display in the\nEdit Role\nmodal, with tabs for API Methods and UI Views, respectively.\nUpdate the role name, if needed.\nUpdate the role description, if needed.\nLocate the permissions you would like to grant or remove.\nFilter the list by typing in the search box.\nAdd or remove permitted endpoints by selecting the checkbox.\nClick\nSave\nto finalize your changes.\nFigure 11: Edit Custom Role\nDeleting a Custom Role\n‚ö†\nCAUTION\nThis is a hard delete. Deleting a custom role will remove references to the role from all users and groups assigned to it.\nAs with other custom modifications, only custom roles may be deleted.\nLocate the custom role you wish to delete. Filter the list using the filter fields in the column header.\nClick the stacked dots menu icon and click\nDelete\nfor the role.\nConfirm the the custom role has been deleted from the Roles table view.\nExporting Authorization Data\nCustomers have the ability to export a list of Users, Groups, and Roles from the\nAuthorization\ninterface into a CSV-formatted file, which can be named and saved to a download folder on your system. The CSV data, in turn, can be used as a reference list (data report) to help track what role a user belongs to and see the groups to which each user belongs.\nTo utilize this export feature you:\nMust have assigned permissions to read/write roles on user and group entities.\nMust have assigned permissions to perform the export.\nTo export your authorization data:\nNavigate to\nAdmin Essentials\n‚Üí\nAuthorization\n.\nClick the export icon. A confirmation dialog displays.\nClick the\nDownload\nbutton. A copy of a CSV-formatted file is downloaded to your system.\nGo to the location where the CSV file is saved.\nOpen the CSV file in your spreadsheet application of choice (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Smartsheet, etc). In our example, Microsoft Excel is used.\nFigure 12: Export Authorization Data\nFigure 13: Authorization Data File\nThe items in the CSV file and what they represent are reference below.\nColumn Header\nDescription\nUser ID\nIdentifier of the user account.\nProvenance\nThe name of the AAA the user comes from.\nUsername\nThe unique name of the user account.\nFirst name\nThe user‚Äôs first name.\nEmail\nThe email address associated with the user account.\nLast Login\nThe last date and time of login.\nActive\nA boolean to indicate if the user account is active. Uses the values ‚Äútrue/false‚Äù.\nGroups Names\nA list of group names to which the user belongs. Each group name includes its provenance.\nRoles Names\nA list of roles which are assigned to the user.\nAuthorization Clients\nThe Authorization\nClients\nview displays a list of clients for\nService Accounts\n. Click on the Clients name in the list to open the Client Details page, which displays the Client ID and a timestamp identifying the date and time a Client Secret was generated. Use the toggle switch located at the top to enable (turn on) or disable (turn off) the Service Account. Authentication is not permitted against disabled Service Accounts.\nFor security reasons, the ability to edit a Service Account client is protected by the\nservice-accounts:read\nand\nservice-accounts:write\nCloud application roles. To grant a user the right to edit client permissions for a Service Account, you must enable these roles in the groups whose users need to create or modify Service Accounts.\nFigure 14: Authorization Clients\nFigure 15: Client Details\nService Accounts\nApplications that need a point of entry to interact with Itential Platform APIs in order to perform tasks are created as\nService Accounts\nin Itential Platform. Using OAuth2 protocols that work over HTTPS to send a client token ID and secret key, authorization policies and controls are applied to limit what the requesting application is permitted to do and for how long. The client ID is used to identify the Service Account and the secret key is used to provide proof of right-to-access. Most notably, the client ID and secret key associated with a Service Account may be distributed to one or more Service Applications.\nThere are several benefits to encapsulating applications as Service Accounts in Itential Platform. This functionality:\nProvides a more secure way to connect Itential Platform to external systems via one set of login information.\nUses tokenization to give limited access to user data across applications and devices.\nProtects user data by providing access via client token ID without revealing user credentials.\nAllows third-party services to make requests on behalf of a user without accessing passwords and other sensitive information.\nService Account Properties\nService account properties and a sample configuration are referenced below.\nParameter\nType\nDescription\nname\nstring\nThe specific name associated with the Service Account.\ndescription\nstring\nA brief description of the service account for the external system.\nclient_id\nstring\nAuto-generated by Itential Platform; can be copied by the administrator.\nclient_secret\nstring\nAuto-generated by Itential Platform; can be copied by the administrator.\ngrant_type\nstring\nA JSON Web Token (JWT) providing the service application authenticated access to Itential Platform for a set amount of time.\nExample Service Account Configuration\n\"accountData\" : {\n  \"name\": \"Service Account Hello\",\n  \"description\": \"This is a service account\",\n  \"client_id\": \"638e17011ba61d5e222a16ab\",\n  \"client_secret\": \"94367284-b12a-4858-b6c1-0bb11f1f126b\",\n  \"grant_type\": \"xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz\"\n}\nRelated Reading\nHow to Configure OAuth2 Inside of Postman in Service Accounts\nService Account APIs\nListed below are the four CRUD APIs with admin-level permissions used to support and manage service accounts.\nAPI\nDescription\ncreateserviceAccount\nCreates a service account in the Mongo database.\ngetServiceAccounts\nReturns the service account based on query parameters, but does not include \"clientSecret\" in any of the data that is returned.

Use the information in this guide to set property values and other parameters for\nadapter-automation_gateway\n. These properties tell the adapter how to communicate with the system.\nRelated Reading: Itential Opensource\nItential Platform Service Instance Configurations\nAdapter Properties\nProperty\nType\nDescription\nhost\nString\nRequired. The hostname of the Automation Gateway adapter.\nport\nNumber\nRequired. The port on which to connect to the adapter. Default port is 443.\nchoosepath\nString\nThis property allows users to control which path to utilize for an API call. The Endpoint Configuration for the adapter must have an array of entitypaths in order to use\nchoosepath\n.\nÔÅö\nFor the gateway adapter, the\nchoosepath\nproperty can be empty (left blank) or set to\nv0\nto work in default mode.  To honor the\nbase_path\nconfiguration listed below, the value of\nchoosepath\nmust be set to\nv1\n.\nbase_path\nstring\nA base path appears in most, if not all, API calls. Users can override the base path on individual actions, as needed, in the Endpoint Configuration for the adapter. Using base path makes it easier to maintain the adapter whenever changes are made to the API path.\nÔÅö\nIf the path changes from\n/xyz\nto\n/api/rest\n, users only need to change the property instead of having to change the entitypath on every action in the Endpoint Configuration for the adapter.\nExample:\nFor\nhttp://xyz.abc.com:8080/api/rest/v1/abc\nthe base path is\n/api/rest\n.\nversion\nString\nRequired.

Default is\nhttp\n.\nhealthcheck\nObject\nRequired. Defines the types of health check settings currently supported.\nthrottle\nObject\nOptional. Defines the properties used to throttle requests to Automation Gateway.\nrequest\nObject\nDefines the properties used to handle requests and responses.\nproxy\nObject\nDefines the properties used to handle requests and responses.\nssl\nObject\nRequired. Defines the properties to utilize SSL authentication with Automation Gateway.\nstrip_escapes\nBoolean\nOptional. Strips out additional backslashes from all API calls. The default setting is off,\nfalse\n. To enable, change to\ntrue\n. The default setting is recommended unless an issue arises where extra escape characters (i.e., backslashes) are added to API calls that should be removed.\nAuthentication\nProperty\nType\nDescription\nauth_method\nString\nDefines the authentication method used in requests. Valid authentication methods include\nrequest_token\n(default),\nstatic_token\n, and\nno_authentication\n.\nusername\nString\nThe username to authenticate with Automation Gateway on every request or when pulling a token that will be used in subsequent requests.\npassword\nString\nThe password to authenticate with Automation Gateway on every request or when pulling a token that will be used in subsequent requests. If retrieved through an encrypt password call, use the exact return including the\n{code}\n.\ntoken\nString\nDefines a static token that can be used on all requests.\ntoken_user_field\nString\nThe field in the token request where the username credential should be provided.\ntoken_password_field\nString\nThe field in the token request where the password credential should be provided.\ntoken_result_field\nString\nDefines the field in the token response where the actual token will be.\ntoken_URI_path\nString\nThe API path used to retrieve a token.\ntoken_timeout\nNumber\nDefines how long a token is valid. Measured in milliseconds. Once a dynamic token is no longer valid, Itential Platform has to pull a new token. Default is set to -1 (minus one), which means Itential Platform pulls a token on every request. Maximum value is 3600000.\ninvalid_token_error\nNumber\nDefines the HTTP error that is received when a token is invalid. Notifies the adapter to pull a new token and retry the request. Default is 401.\nauth_field\nString\nDefines the header field in which to place the token.\nauth_field_format\nString\nDefines the format used to pass the authentication variables.\nHealthcheck\nThe following settings are currently supported.\nNone\n- Not recommended. Itential Platform will not run a check on Automation Gateway. Consequently, it is unable to determine if Itential can connect with Automation Gateway.\nStartup\n- Itential will check for connectivity when the adapter initially comes up, but it will not check afterwards.\nIntermittent\n- The adapter will check connectivity to Automation Gateway at the frequency defined in the frequency property\nProperty\nType\nDescription\ntype\nString\nThe type of health check to run. Default is\nIntermittent\n.\nfrequency\nNumber\nDefines how often the health check should run. Measured in milliseconds (minimum = 6000, maximum = 3600000). Default is 300000.\nprotocol\nString\nDefines the protocol (\nREST\n,\nSOAP\n,\nRPC\n,\nSocket\n, etc.) to use to check the health of the system. Default is\nREST\n.\nuri_path\nString\nThe path used to check the health of Automation Gateway. This call should be a simple request for information that does not require any parameters.\nThrottle\nProperty\nType\nDescription\nthrottle_enabled\nBoolean\nDefines if the adapter should use throttling. Default is\nfalse\n.\nnumber_pronghorns\nNumber\nDefines if throttling is done in a single instance of Itential Platform or whether requests are being throttled across multiple instances of Itential Platform (minimum = 1, maximum = 20). Default is 1. Throttling a single instance uses an in-memory queue so there is less overhead. Throttling across multiple instances requires placing the request and queue information into a shared resource, e.g. a database, so that each instance can determine what is running and what is next to run. Throttling across multiple instances requires additional I/O overhead.\nsync_async\nString\nDefines if the queue handle requests synchronously or asynchronously.\nmax_in_queue\nNumber\nRepresents the maximum number of requests Itential Platform should allow into the queue before rejecting requests (minimum = 1, maximum = 5000). Default is 1000.\nconcurrent_max\nNumber\nDefines the number of requests that Itential Platform can send to Automation Gateway at one time (minimum = 1, maximum = 1000). Default is 1; each request must be sent to Automation Gateway in a serial manner.\nexpire_timeout\nNumber\nDefines the graceful timeout of the request session. After a request has completed, Itential Platform will wait additional time prior to sending the next request. Measured in milliseconds (minimum = 0, maximum = 60000). Default is 0.\navg_runtime\nNumber\nRepresents the approximate average of how long it takes Automation Gateway to handle each request. Measured in milliseconds (minimum = 50, maximum = 60000). Default is 200. This metric has performance implications. If the number is set too low, it puts extra burden on Itential Platform CPU and memory as the requests will continually try to run. If the number is set too high, requests may wait longer than they need to before running. The number does not need to be exact but your throttling strategy depends heavily on this number being within reason. If averages range from 50 to 250 milliseconds you might pick an average run-time somewhere in the middle so that when your Automation Gateway performance is exceptional you might run a little slower than you might like, but when it is poor you still run efficiently.\nRequest\nProperty\nType\nDescription\nnumber_retires\nNumber\nRequired. Defines how many times to retry a request that has aborted or reached the limit before returning an error (minimum = 0, maximum = 20). Default is 3.\nlimit_retry_error\nNumber\nOptional. Indicates the HTTP error status code. Defines when no capacity is available and after waiting a short interval the adapter can retry the request (minimum = 0, maximum = 1000). Default is set to 0 (zero).\nattempt_timeout\nNumber\nOptional. Defines how long Itential Platform should wait before aborting an attempt to connect. Measured in milliseconds (minimum = 1000, maximum = 360000). Default is 5000.\nhealthcheck_on_timeout\nBoolean\nDefines if the system should run a health check on timeout. Default is false. If set to true, the adapter will abort the request and run a health check until it re-establishes connectivity to Automation Gateway and then it will re-attempt the request.\narchiving\nBoolean\nOptional. Default is false. Archives each request and response, and corresponding metrics (i.e., wait time, connection time,  Automation Gateway time) in the\nadapterid_results\ncollection in MongoDB. Before enabling this property, develop an archiving strategy for cleaning up the collection in the database so that it does not become too large, especially if the responses are large.\nProxy\nProperty\nType\nDescription\nenabled\nBoolean\nDefines whether or not there is a proxy. Default is\nfalse\n.\nhost\nString\nThe host name of the proxy. Default is\nlocalhost\n.\nport\nNumber\nThe port used to connect to the proxy. Default is\n443\n.\nprotocol\nString\nThe protocol (i.e.,\nhttp\n,\nhttps\n,\nsocks4\n,\nsocks5\n, etc.) used to connect to the proxy.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-search-api", "title": "Operations Manager Search APIs", "text": "Operations Manager Search APIs\nUpdated on\nFeb 20, 2025\nPublished on Jun 6, 2023\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nOperations Manager (\"Ops Manager\") includes two search APIs that support advanced functionality through query parameters.\nSearch API\nGET /operations-manager/jobs\nGET /operations-manager/tasks\nNote:\nThe information presented herein applies only to the\n/jobs\nand\n/tasks\nAPIs.\nQuery Parameter Syntax\nOperations Manager uses an object syntax to express operators and their relationship to the fields they operate on. For example, to get all documents that have a field equal to a particular value, use the following syntax:\nequals[field]=value\nThis syntax allows the search API to accept multiple field conditions in a single request. Likewise, to get all the jobs with the name\nJob name 1\nand description\nJob description 1\n, the following request could be made:\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?equals[name]=Job name 1&equals[description]=Job description 1\nThe API supports querying on nested properties within a document using\ndotted path notation\n. For example, to get all tasks which were started after\n2021-11-18\n, the following request could be made:\nGET /operations-manager/tasks?gt[metrics.start_time]=2021-11-18T23:59:59\nWorkflow Task Query Parameter Syntax\nThe\n/operations-manager/jobs\nand\n/operations-manager/tasks\nAPIs can be invoked in workflows by using the\ngetJobs\nand\ngetTasks\nworkflow tasks, respectively. Query parameters are provided to these tasks in JSON object format using the\nqueryParameters\nvariable. For example, to get all documents that have a field equal to a particular value, use the following syntax:\n{ \"equals\": { \"field\": \"value\" } }\nTo get all jobs with the name\nJob name 1\nand description\nJob description 1\n:\n{\n  \"equals\": {\n    \"name\": \"Job name 1\",\n    \"description\": \"Job description 1\"\n  }\n}\nResponse Format\nOperations Manager standardizes the top-level structure of all responses, both success and error, with the following fields.\nProperty\nDescription\nmessage\nThis property contains a human readable message, and will always be populated with a string.\ndata\nThis property contains any data that is directly related to the request. This key will always be present; if it is not applicable to the request (as with error responses), it will be set to\nnull\n.\nmetadata\nThis property contains any extra details on the response. When no metadata is available, this will be an empty object. This field is used in several places, including pagination information in search responses, as well as detailed reports on failed imports and input validation failures.\nExample Response\n{\n  \"message\": \"Human readable message\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"some\": \"data\"\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"some\": \"metadata\"\n  }\n}\nBasic Examples\nTo get all jobs that have a name starting with the string\n'Job name prefix'\n:\nExample API Format\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?starts-with[name]=Job name prefix\nExample Workflow Task Format\n{\n  \"starts-with\": {\n    \"name\": \"Job name prefix\"\n  }\n}\nTo get the IDs and names of all jobs started after November 18, 2021, use Unix epoch time format (\n1637279999\n):\nExample API Format\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?include=_id,name&gt[metrics.start_time]=1637279999\nExample Workflow Task Format\n{\n  \"include\": \"_id,name\",\n  \"gt\": {\n    \"metrics.start_time\": \"1637279999\"\n  }\n}\nSearch Operators\nThis section outlines the available search operators used to narrow the focus of a search query.\nequals\nThe\nequals\noperator returns documents with a field exactly matching the specified value. The field type is known to Operations Manager, meaning there is no need for an API consumer to specify which fields should be interpreted as Dates, ObjectIds, booleans, etc. Operations Manager will interpret the value according to the structure of the document being queried.\nExample Requests\nAPI Format\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?equals[name]=JobName\nWorkflow Task Format\n{\n  \"equals\": {\n    \"name\": \"JobName\"\n  }\n}\nstarts-with, ends-with, contains\nThese three related search operators return documents with a field that either\nstarts-with\n,\nends-with\n, or\ncontains\nthe specified string.\nNote:\nSpecifically for the\n/jobs\nAPI, the\ndescription\nproperty has special behavior when queried with\ncontains\n. When filtering over the description field on jobs, MongoDB text search syntax is supported. This allows efficient searching for complex expressions in the description field even when the jobs collection grows very large. Please refer to\nText Search in the MongoDB Manual\nfor details on supported behavior.\nExample Requests\nAPI Format\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?starts-with[name]=NamePrefix\nGET /operations-manager/tasks?ends-with[name]=Suffix\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?contains[description]=InternalString\nWorkflow Task Format\n{\n    \"starts-with\": {\n        \"name\": \"NamePrefix\"\n    }\n}\n\n{\n    \"ends-with\": {\n        \"name\": \"Suffix\"\n    }\n}\n\n{\n    \"contains\": {\n        \"description\": \"InternalString\"\n    }\n}\nin, not-in\nThe\nin\noperator accepts a comma-separated list of options and returns documents with a field that is exactly equal to one of the specified options.\nFor example, to get jobs with a name of either\nName 1\n,\nName 2\n, or\nName 3\n, the following request could be used:\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?in[name]=Name 1,Name 2,Name 3\nThe\nnot-in\noperator also accepts a comma-separated list of options and returns documents with a field that is not equal to any of the specified options.\nIf the search value contains a comma, it is important to explicitly percent encode that comma (a comma is percent encoded as\n%2C\n), otherwise Operations Manager will interpret it as multiple options rather than a single option with comma characters inside. For example, to search for jobs with a name of either\nName,1\nor\nName,2\n, use the following request:\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?in[name]=Name%2C1,Name%2C2\nThe\nin\nand\nnot-in\noperators interpret the items in the option list according to the type of the specified field, as with the\nequals\noperator.\nExample Requests\nAPI Format\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?in[name]=EitherThis,OrThis,OrMaybeThis\nGET /operations-manager/tasks?not-in[description]=NotThis,NorThis\nWorkflow Task Format\n{\n    \"in\": {\n        \"name\": \"EitherThis,OrThis,OrMaybeThis\"\n    }\n}\n\n{\n    \"not-in\": {\n        \"description\": \"NotThis,NorThis\"\n    }\n}\ngt, lt, gte, lte\nThese operators provide support for comparison operators in searches. Use\ngt\nfor greater than comparisons,\nlt\nfor less than,\ngte\nfor greater than or equal to, and\nlte\nfor less than or equal to.\nThe values provided to these operators are interpreted based on the type of the specified field, as with the\nequals\n,\nin\n, and\nnot-in\noperators.\nExample Requests\nAPI Format\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?gt[metrics.progress]=0.5\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?lte[metrics.start_time]=1637279999\nWorkflow Task Format\n{\n    \"gt\": {\n        \"metrics.progress\": 0.5\n    }\n}\n\n{\n    \"lte\": {\n        \"metrics.start_time\": \"1669675620370\"\n    }\n}\n?q=\nThe\n?q=\nquery parameter exposes a way of doing more complex searches than are possible with other top-level query parameters. The advantage of this parameter is that it not only supports all top-level query parameters as described above, but also logical combinations of those parameters with\nand\n,\nor\n, and\nnot\n.\nTo use the\n?q=\nquery parameter:\nCreate a query string in JSON object format:\n{\n  \"equals\": { \"name\": \"my name\" },\n  \"starts-with\": { \"description\": \"Some desc prefix\" }\n}\nURL encode the JSON object using\nencodeURLComponent\n.\n%7B%22equals%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%22my%20name%22%7D%2C%22starts-with%22%3A%7B%22description%22%3A%22Some%20desc%20prefix%22%7D%7D\nConstruct a new query string in which the encoded JSON object is passed to the\n?q=\nquery parameter:\n?q=%7B%22equals%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%22my%20name%22%7D%2C%22starts-with%22%3A%7B%22description%22%3A%22Some%20desc%20prefix%22%7D%7D\nProjection Parameters\nProjection parameters are used to limit the fields returned in the API response. The fields returned may be specified either using an inclusive list with\ninclude\n, or an exclusive list with\nexclude\n.\nNote:\nWhen specifying an inclusive list, the\n_id\nfield is implicitly included, even if it is not specified. To exclude it from the list, use\n&exclude=_id\nalongside the\ninclude\nexpression to remove it.\ninclude\nThe\ninclude\nparameter accepts a comma-delineated list of property names. This specifies the set of properties to include in the API response.\nExample Request and Response\nAPI Format\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?include=name,description\nWorkflow Task Format\n{\n  \"include\": \"name,description\"\n}\nResponse\nNote the properties included in the\ndata\narray.\n{\n  \"message\": \"Successfully retrieved items\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"_id\": \"000000000000000000000000\",\n      \"name\": \"Job 1\",\n      \"description\": \"Job description 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"_id\": \"111111111111111111111111\",\n      \"name\": \"Job 2\",\n      \"description\": \"Job description 2\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"skip\": 0,\n    \"limit\": 100,\n    \"nextPageSkip\": null,\n    \"previousPageSkip\": null,\n    \"total\": 2,\n    \"currentPageSize\": 2\n  }\n}\nexclude\nThe\nexclude\nparameter specifies the set of properties to exclude in the API response.\nExample Request and Response\nNote the addition of\n&exclude=_id\n.\nAPI Format\nGET /operations-manager/jobs?include=name,description&exclude=_id\nWorkflow Task Format\n{\n  \"include\": \"name,description\",\n  \"exclude\": \"_id\"\n}\nResponse\n{\n  \"message\": \"Successfully retrieved items\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Job 1\",\n      \"description\": \"Job description 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Job 2\",\n      \"description\": \"Job description 2\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"skip\": 0,\n    \"limit\": 100,\n    \"nextPageSkip\": null,\n    \"previousPageSkip\": null,\n    \"total\": 2,\n    \"currentPageSize\": 2\n  }\n}\nSort Parameters\nSort parameters arrange query results in a specified sequence (order) for any extracted data or list elements. Sorting is activated by\n?sort=< field >\nand\n?order=< -1 | 1 >\n.\nUse both parameters to specify the sort order; in other words, they must be used together (cannot skip one).\norder\nmust be\n-1\nor\n1\nsort\nmust be a valid field path within the queried document type\nWhen querying\n/jobs\n, you can provide:\n?sort=metrics.start_time\nBut do\nnot\nuse:\n?sort=metrics.some_other_field\nThe\nsort\nparameter must not be excluded from the resulting document with projection parameters.\nPagination Parameters\nMost API endpoints that return a list of entities have some sort of pagination. Use the\n?skip=< number >\nand\n?limit=< number >\nparameters to limit the results returned by the query and control the paging of all documents returned in a result set.\nskip\nand\nlimit\nmust be

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/jobs-operations-manager-itential-platform", "title": "Jobs & Job Metrics", "text": "Jobs & Job Metrics\nUpdated on\nMay 20, 2025\nPublished on Jun 6, 2023\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nEvery time you run a workflow in Itential Platform, a corresponding job is created. A\njob\nis an instance of a workflow, along with its runtime data, that is in some state of execution on the platform: running, paused, canceled, or completed. Knowing how to manage jobs is essential to successful workflow execution, in which Operations Manager will serve as your job management hub.\nThis page provides an overview of job-related features in Operations Manager. On it, you will learn:\nHow to use the\nJobs\ntable to monitor job status and perform job actions.\nHow to use job visualizations, also known as the\nJob Details\nview, to view job properties, interact with a job's tasks, and troubleshoot job errors.\nJobs Table\nOperations Manager displays all available jobs via table view. This table, the\nJobs table\n, can be used to monitor job status and perform basic job management actions, such as pausing, watching, canceling, or deleting jobs. It is present in two locations:\nThe Operations Manager dashboard.\nThe Jobs page, accessible from the side navigation menu.\nThe functionality of the Jobs table remains the same regardless.\nFigure 1: Operations Manager Dashboard\nÔÅö\nJobs Page\nOpening the Jobs page may pre-apply a filter to the Jobs table, depending on which link you select from the side navigation menu. For example, selecting\nAll Jobs\nwill bring you to a page displaying an unfiltered Jobs table, while selecting\nErrored Jobs\nwill only list jobs in an error state.\nÔÅö\nVersion Differences\nJob deletion was introduced in the 2023.1.18 version of Itential Platform. It is unavailable in earlier versions.\nThe Jobs table is comprised of the following elements:\nLabel\nUI Element\nFunction\n1\nToolbar\nFrom left to right:\n‚Ä¢ Pause selected jobs (\n)\n‚Ä¢ Cancel selected jobs (\n)\n‚Ä¢ Watch selected jobs (\n)\n‚Ä¢ Clear any filters applied to the Jobs table (\n)\n‚Ä¢ Delete selected jobs (\n)\n‚Ä¢ Toggle to filter the Jobs table to show only watched jobs\nÔÅö\nPausing Jobs:\nActively running tasks will finish execution even if their containing job is paused. Furthermore, if an actively running task is the final task in a job, the job will complete as normal after task execution. The main exception to these rules is the\nchildJob\ntask, which will pause execution in step with its containing job.\nÔÅö\nDeleting Jobs:\nOnly completed or canceled jobs can be deleted.\nÔÅö\nDeleting Parent Jobs:\nDeleting a parent job will also delete all of its children. This is the only way that child jobs can be deleted.\n2\nFilter Column Visibility\nSelect which, if any, optional columns should be displayed on the Jobs table.\nÔÅö\nVersion Differences:\nThe\nJob Type\ncolumn was introduced in the 2023.1.18 version of Itential Platform.\n3\nFilter Controls\nTailor your view of the Jobs table based on specific criteria (job name, job status, job type, etc).\n4\nMenu Button\nOpens a context menu of job management actions. Notably, this menu contains the\nView (\n)\noption. Selecting this will open the job's\nvisualization\n.\n5\nJob List\nView and manage your available jobs. Select jobs from the list to target them with toolbar actions. Click the job name, description, or identifier to open its\nvisualization\n.\n6\nPagination Controls\nSet the number of jobs that should be displayed on each table page and cycle through these pages.\nFigure 2: Jobs Table\nJob Visualizations\nThe Jobs table is a useful tool for ascertaining job status at a glance and performing quick management actions; however, it does not feature in-depth tooling necessary for more detailed job operations. In those situations, you should open a job's\nvisualization\n, also known as the\nJob Details view\n. Here, an interactive diagram of your job will be displayed, allowing you to perform advanced management actions, such as viewing job properties, interacting with job tasks, and troubleshooting job errors.\nJob visualizations are comprised of the following elements as referenced below.\nLabel\nUI Element\nFunction\n1\nWorkflow Diagram\nCanvas view of the associated workflow in a job. Tasks are appended with status icons, tracking the progress of your job's execution.\n2\nError History\nView information about any\nerrors\nyour job has encountered.\n3\nStatus Indicator\nDetermine the overall status of your job.\n4\nMenu Button\nOpens a context menu. Relevant actions will be displayed based on the job's current state.\n5\nJob Properties Panel\nView advanced information\nabout your job as a whole.\n6\nJob Details Panel\nView advanced information about and interact with your job's\ntasks\n.\nFigure 3: Job Visualization\nViewing Job Properties\nThe\nJob Properties\npanel, located on the right-hand side of the visualization, displays runtime information about your job. This information is organized into two tabs:\nThe\nDetails\ntab displays a job's metadata properties, such as its identifier, description, start date, and associated workflow.\nThe\nJob Variables\ntab displays the runtime values of any job variables present.\nTo view this information, simply click the desired tab.\nFigure 4: Job Properties (Details Tab & Job Variables Tab)\nÔÅö\nVersion Differences:\nPrior to the 2023.1 Itential Platform version, multiple types of workflows could be created in Automation Studio. Because each workflow type has a unique feature set, the contents of the Job Properties panel can differ depending on which type of workflow is associated with the job.\nJob Details\nThe\nJob Details\npanel, located at the bottom of the visualization, serves as a control panel for viewing and managing your job's tasks. It is presented in a table format, similar to the\nJobs table\nUI:\nLabel\nUI Element\nFunction\n1\nToolbar\nFrom left to right: clear any filters applied to the Job Details table (\n); select which, if any, optional columns should be displayed on the Job Details table (\n); or filter the Job Details table to show only\nactionable tasks\n.\n2\nStart Auto-Work\nEnable the\nAuto-Work\nfeature. If Auto-Work is already enabled, this button will instead be labeled\nStop Auto-Work\n.\n3\nFilter Controls\nTailor your view of the Job Details table using filters.\n4\nMenu Button\nOpens a context menu. Relevant actions will be displayed based on the task's current state.\n5\nTask List\nView and manage available tasks.\n6\nPagination Controls\nSet the number of tasks that should be displayed on each table page and cycle through these pages.\nFigure 5: Job Details Table\nSeveral common job management tasks are detailed in the subsections below.\nViewing Task Information\nIn much the same way as the Job Properties panel provides information about your job as a whole, the\nTask Properties\npanel provides information about the individual tasks that compose your job.\nTo access the Task Properties panel:\nLocate your desired task on the Job Details table.\nClick the\nView (\n)\nbutton located at the end of the relevant table row; this button may initially be hidden by a context menu. The Job Properties panel will transform into the\nTask Properties\npanel.\nWhen you are finished, click the\nBack to Job Properties (\n)\nbutton located at the top-left corner of the Task Properties panel.\nThe information displayed by the Task Properties panel is organized into three tabs:\nThe\nActions\ntab contains actions that can be performed on the selected task, such as working or retrying it.\nThe\nVariables\ntab contains job variables related to the selected task.\nThe\nDetails\ntab contains the task's metadata properties, such as status, name, and description.\nTo view this information, simply click the desired tab.\nFigure 6: Task Properties Panel (Actions Tab, Variables Tab, Details Tab)\nInteracting with Actionable Tasks\nYou can interact with any\nactionable tasks\npresent in your job directly from the Job Details table. To do so:\nLocate your desired task on the Job Details table.\nClick the menu button located at the end of the relevant table row; a context menu appears.\nA\nWork (\n)\nor\nRetry (\n)\nbutton will be listed in the context menu, depending on which type of actionable task you are interacting with. Click the applicable button.\nÔÅö\nAuto-Work:\nTo interact with actionable tasks automatically as your job progresses, enable the\nAuto-Work\nfeature by either:\nClicking the\nAuto-Work\nbutton located at the top-right corner of the Job Details panel.\nAppending the\n?autoWork=true\nquery string to the URL of a running job. This is useful for inserting links in automated communications such as e-mails and alerts.\nIn general, Auto-Work will execute until it exhausts all actionable tasks or a user clicks the\nStop Auto-Work\nbutton; however, it will be disabled prematurely if a user navigates away from the Job Details page, including by opening other jobs.\nReverting Tasks\nWhile your job is in a paused or errored state, you can use the\nRevert (\n)\nbutton of any successfully completed task, accessible via its context menu or\nTask Properties panel\n, to re-run the job from that task forward. This allows you to re-attempt a portion of job execution to fix task errors, such as incorrect manual task inputs or remote service timeouts, that may otherwise result in the failure of the job.\nViewing Job Errors\nAs your job executes, Operations Manager continuously monitors the status of its component tasks, taking note of any errors that occur. These errors are cataloged on the Job Errors table, accessible by clicking the\nError History\nbutton located near the top-right corner of the visualization.\nTo copy information from the table to your system clipboard, simply hover over the relevant table field and click the\nCopy to Clipboard (\n)\nicon that appears.\nFigure 7: Job Errors Table\nÔÅö\nTask Properties Error Information:\nTask errors are also displayed via the\nTask Properties\npanel. In such cases, the Actions tab will be replaced by the\nError\ntab, as shown below.\nFigure 8: Error Tab\nJob Metrics\nJob Metrics\nis a hub for analyzing time savings and performance statistics for automations. To access from Operations Manager, click the\nJob Metrics\nicon in the\nIcon Bar\non the top-left.\nFigure 9: Operations Manager Job Metrics Icon\nJob Metrics Overview\nJob Metrics Overview\nis the entry point into Job Metrics. From here users can browse previously-run workflows and view basic metrics. Users also can open the detailed metrics for each workflow, or open them in Studio.\nThe main controls of the\nJob Metrics Overview\nwindow are referenced in the table below.\nFigure 10: Job Metrics Overview\nUI Label\nControl\nDescription\n1\nSearch Bar\nSearch for a workflow by name.\n2\nJob Window Filter\nFilter workflows and their metrics by a run window in the past week, past month, or other specified time.\n3\nPie Chart Metric Dropdown\nChoose which metric is displayed in the pie chart.\n4\nColumn Sorting\nClick on a column header (Workflow, Jobs Run, Time Saved) to sort the workflow results by that column.\n5\nAction Icons\nClick the\nView\nicon (eye) to view\njob details\n. Click the\nEdit\nicon (pencil) to open the workflow in Automation Studio.\n6\nPagination\nUsed to show the total number of pages and to set how many workflows to show on a page. View additional workflow results by navigating to the next page.\nJob Metric Details\nThe\nJob Metric Details\ndialog shows detailed metrics data for an individual workflow. From here, users can delve into more specific time savings and performance metrics for the workflow. Users can also view performance data on individual tasks within the workflow.\nThe main controls of the\nJob Metric Details\ndialog are referenced in the table below.\nFigure 11: Job Metric Details\nUI Label\nControl\nDescription\n1\nBack to Overview\nClick to return to the Job Metrics Overview dialog.\n2\nJob Window Filter\nFilter the workflow metrics by a run window in the past week, past month, or other specified time.\n3\nChart Task Type\nFilter the tasks displayed in the Task Breakdown chart to a certain task type (e.g., automatic or manual).\n4\nChart Result Type\nFilter the task data displayed in the Task Breakdown chart to task runs with a given result (e.g., success, error, or failure).\n5\nChart Data Type\nChange the y-axis data displayed in the Task Breakdown between average runtimes and total runtimes.\nSetting Up Savings Metrics\nIn order to track metrics such as time saved and SLA target percentage, some additional input is needed for each workflow.\nFigure 12: Savings Metrics\nOpen\nAutomation Studio\n.\nOpen the workflow you would like to track savings metrics for.\nClick the\nView metadata\noption (Figure 13) from the stacked dots menu icon in the top-right. The\nWorkflow Settings\ndialog opens.\nSet the\nPre-Automation Time\nand\nSLA Per Workflow\nfields using the time wheel and click\nSave\n.\nFigure 13: View Metadata\nFigure 14: Metric Fields\nMetric Field\nField Description\nPre-Automation Time\nThe time it would take for the workflow to perform and complete its work without the use of Itential Platform.

In this case:\nThe\nx-itential-variable\nproperties are not specific to the security scheme (i.e., not specific to\noauth2\n).\nThe\nx-itential-use-in\nproperty defines the specific requests the parameter is used in.\nThe\nclient_assertion\nheader is set to be the\nclientAssertion\nvariable defined in the integration and used in both token and refresh requests.\nIf\nx-itential-variable\nis not defined on a parameter, the value used in the request is set under \"parameters\" in the integration and is specific to the security scheme.\nFor additional detail on OpenAPI specification extensions and how they are used by Itential, see the next section of this article.\nThe image presented below depicts the custom configuration parameters for the example Integration Model (example) shown above.\nFigure 4: Integration Custom URI Parameters\nItential Specification Extensions\nThis section will explain Itential‚Äôs custom OpenAPI specification extensions and how they impact API interactions.\nExtension\nType\nDescription\nx-itential-variable\nstring\n‚Ä¢ Used in\nParameter Objects\nand allows users to define variables that will be captured in the Service Configuration properties per instance of an Integration and is not optional.\n‚Ä¢ The value of this field is the variable name, which is also a unique identifier.  This means that if the same variable name is used in multiple different places, then it will generate only one variable, whose given runtime value will be used more than once.\nx-itential-parameters\nparameter-object[]\n‚Ä¢ The Open API specification has a model for parameters, which are parts of an API request like headers, query parameters, path parameters, and cookies.  The only places where these can be defined are in the:\nComponents Object\n,\nPath Item Object\n, and\nOperation Object\n. The\nOperation Object\nis the root of the OpenAPI document and where the parameters would apply to all APIs modeled in the document. Another location is inside the\nSecurity Scheme Object\n, where additional parameters may be needed for Authorization.\n‚Ä¢ The\nParameter Objects\nin the array are near identical to the OpenAPI Specification definition of a Parameter Object.  The only difference is that the parameters in a Security Scheme Object are allowed to use the additional value of\n\"body\"\nfor the\n\"in\"\nfield, when the security request will have an\nx-www-form-urlencoded\nrequest body (ex. OAuth 2.0 grant flows).\n‚Ä¢ When defined at the root level, the parameters are applicable for all the operations described in the Open API Model. These parameters can be overridden at the\nPath Item Object\nand\nOperation Object\nlevels, but cannot be removed. The list\nMUST NOT\ninclude duplicated parameters. A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a\nname\nand\nlocation\n. The list can use the\nReference Object\nto link to parameters that are defined by the\ncomponents-parameters\nthat comprise the OpenAPI Specification Object.\nx-itential-use-in\nstring[]\n‚Ä¢ In most places where parameters are defined, the definition of a request is individual. When additional parameters are defined during OAuth 2.0 grant flows, the model applies to multiple requests. The best example of this is the Authorization Code Grant Flow, which can have an authorization request (\nauthorizationUrl\n), access token request (\ntokenUrl\n), and refresh token request (\nrefreshUrl\n). If using the security scheme type\nopenIdConnect\n, there can also be an\nopenIdConnectUrl\n.\n‚Ä¢ Values in the string will be any of the following:\n\"authorization\"\n,\n\"token\"\n,\n\"refresh\"\n,\n\"openIdConnect\"\n.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "OpenAPI 3.1 Authentication & Authorization"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "OAUTH2 and OIDC"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Example"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Itential Specification Extensions"}], "code_blocks": ["x-itential-parameters", "x-itential-parameters", "x-itential-parameters", "{\n    \"openapi\" : \"3.0.0\",\n    \"info\" : {\n        \"title\" : \"ServiceNow Product Order API\",\n        \"description\" : \"API for managing product orders in ServiceNow\",\n        \"version\" : \"1.0.0\"\n    },\n    \"servers\" : [ \n        {\n            \"url\" : \"https://example.service-now.com\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"paths\" : {\n    },\n    \"security\" : [ \n        {\n            \"oauth2\" : []\n        }\n    ],\n    \"components\" : {\n        \"schemas\" : {\n            \"ProductOrder\" : {\n                \"type\" : \"obje", "{\n    \"openapi\" : \"3.0.0\",\n    \"info\" : {\n        \"title\" : \"ServiceNow Product Order API\",\n        \"description\" : \"API for managing product orders in ServiceNow\",\n        \"version\" : \"1.0.0\"\n    },\n    \"servers\" : [ \n        {\n            \"url\" : \"https://example.service-now.com\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"paths\" : {\n    },\n    \"security\" : [ \n        {\n            \"oauth2\" : []\n        }\n    ],\n    \"components\" : {\n        \"schemas\" : {\n            \"ProductOrder\" : {\n                \"type\" : \"obje", "x-itential-parameters", "x-www-form-urlencoded"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-admin-essentials-integration-token-management-security-schemes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-integrations-mtls-security", "https://swagger.io/docs/specification/openapi-extensions/"]}

Examples of properties that should be encrypted include API tokens, passwords, and secrets. If Hashicorp Vault is configured, all encrypted properties will be stored in Hashicorp Vault using this mechanism. These properties will be decrypted when used in runtime, but will never be stored on the MongoDB document for that service config. If Hashicorp Vault is not configured, no properties can be automatically encrypted.\nHow to set a property to automatically be encrypted\nTo set a property to be encrypted automatically when a service config is created or updated, first this property should exist in the\npropertiesSchema.json\ndocument. This property should be a string, and not a different data type.\nTo support any automatic property encryption, a\npropertiesDecorators.json\ndocument must be created at the same level as the\npropertiesSchema.json\ndocument. This json document must contain an Array type, and will default to\n[]\nif it is not explicitly defined.\nEach element in the array must be an object, containing a type and a pointer. The type must be set to a value of\nencryption\nto work with the encryption set up for these properties decorators. The pointer must be a valid json pointer to a property within the\npropertiesSchema.json\ndocument.\nWithin the UI, any property that has an encryption pointer configured for it will display as\n*****\nunless the user is actively editing that field.\nExample propertiesDecorators.json files\nBelow is an example\npropertiesSchema.json\nfile that will be referenced by the example\npropertiesDecorators.json\nfiles:\n{\n  \"$id\": \"adapter-custom\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"user\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"password\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n          \"token\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n      }\n    },\n    \"url\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nLooking at this schema, it's likely that\ncredentials.password\nand\napi.token\nare sensitive fields. If that's the case, then the\npropertiesDecorators.json\nshould look like this:\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/credentials/password\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/api/token\"\n  }\n]\nHowever, if this assumption was wrong, and for some reason the\nurl\nproperty includes credentials within the URL, and the\napi.token\nfield actually contains a token's type instead of the actual token, the\npropertiesDecorators.json\nfield might look like this:\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/credentials/password\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/url\"\n  }\n]\nDifferences between applications and adapters\nThe\npropertiesDecorators.json\nworks the same for applications and adapters; however, it is worth noting the\npointer\nused in the array starts from a different location based on the type. On an adapter, the properties to encrypt are contained in the\nproperties.properties\nof the service config whereas for an application they are stored in the\nproperties\nof the service config. The json pointer starts from these locations within the service config. This is consistent with the way the\npropertiesSchema.json\nmaps to properties within the service config.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Service Config Property Encryption"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "What properties should be encrypted"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "How to set a property to automatically be encrypted"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Example propertiesDecorators.json files"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Differences between applications and adapters"}], "code_blocks": ["propertiesSchema.json", "propertiesDecorators.json", "propertiesSchema.json", "propertiesSchema.json", "propertiesSchema.json", "propertiesDecorators.json", "{\n  \"$id\": \"adapter-custom\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"user\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"password\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n          \"token\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n      }\n    },\n    \"url\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  }\n}", "{\n  \"$id\": \"adapter-custom\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"user\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"password\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n          \"token\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n      }\n    },\n    \"url\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  }\n}", "propertiesDecorators.json", "[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/credentials/password\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/api/token\"\n  }\n]", "[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/credentials/password\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/api/token\"\n  }\n]", "propertiesDecorators.json", "[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/credentials/password\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/url\"\n  }\n]", "[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/credentials/password\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"encryption\",\n    \"pointer\": \"/url\"\n  }\n]", "propertiesDecorators.json", "properties.properties", "propertiesSchema.json"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/service-brokers-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/serving-ui-directories-itential-platform"]}

This guide will provide several strategies to improve query performance, including proper indexes, TTL indexes, and pruning strategies using scripts.\nQuery Performance\nTo decide whether data should be pruned, query performance should be analyzed to check for proper indexes. Explain plans can be run to indicate the use of indexes on a specific query. For more information, see the\nMongo tutorial on analyzing query performance using explain plans\n.\nIndexes are data structures that MongoDB uses for more efficient queries. If running explain plans on a query reveals the need for an index, it should be created. For more information, see the\nMongoDB manual on indexes\n. A proper indexing strategy takes priority over data pruning for improving query performance. If a collection has all the necessary indexes and query performance is still slow, then other strategies should be employed.\nTTL Index\nIf documents in a collection are not needed after a certain amount of time, a TTL index can be used to automatically remove documents after a specified number of seconds or at an exact time. TTL indexes can only be created on fields with a date value or array of date values. It is not recommended that TTL indexes are used as a primary means for query performance improvements, but should be considered only if it is certain that the data (in a collection) needs to persist for a specific amount of time. For more information, see the\nMongoDB manual on TTL indexes\n.\nCapped Collections\nIf a collection is capped, a limit can be specified on the number of documents or amount of data that can be stored in the collection. Capped collections employ a first-in-first-out strategy, which means that if a document insertion pushes the collection past its maximum constraints, the oldest inserted document is removed. Note that collections can only be capped on creation. Capped collections should only be created if a specific amount of the most recently inserted data is needed. For more information, see the\nMongoDB manual on capped collections\n.\nArchival Strategy\nIf query performance is not sufficient given proper indexes on data that should persist for historical records, an archival strategy can be employed to reduce the amount of data in a collection. This can involve a process that moves a subset of a collection's documents to another collection, database, or other means of persistence. Documents can also be deleted if they no longer need to persist. The specific archival strategy that is used depends on the use case and performance needs.\nArchival Strategy Example for Job Metrics\nBeginning with 2021.1, a dashboard was added to Operations Manager that displays metrics on jobs run in Itential Platform. This dashboard runs queries against the\nwfe_job_metrics\ncollection. Since only one document is inserted per automation, it is rare for the collection to grow large enough to highly impact query performance; however, search performance can degrade if that number becomes high enough over time. In that scenario, it may be necessary to create a script that archives or removes metrics on all jobs completed before a certain date, which could improve query performance. Additionally, job metrics for automations that had no jobs completed in a recent timeframe can be archived. In this example, the importance of query performance should be weighed against the need for the subset of data being archived in the dashbaord.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "MongoDB Query Performance"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Query Performance"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "TTL Index"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Capped Collections"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Archival Strategy"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Archival Strategy Example for Job Metrics"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/mongodb-in-properties-json-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/mongodb-backup-and-recovery"]}
{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/user-account-references-itential-platform", "title": "User Account References", "text": "User Account References\nUpdated on\nFeb 20, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nUser accounts are uniquely identified in Itential Platform by a database ID, or a username and provenance pair where the provenance is the name of the AAA adapter from which the user account originated. This guide lays out best practices for user account representation and discusses:\nReference accounts in database documents.\nReturn data in APIs for documents with referenced accounts.\nQuery documents with referenced accounts.\nSort documents with referenced accounts.\nBest Practices\nAccount References in Database Documents\nReferences to user accounts should be made via database ID. In MongoDB, accounts are keyed with\nObjectId\n, and the reference should use that type as well. This allows the application to make use of\n$lookup\nin the MongoDB aggregation pipeline for purposes of sorting and filtering by account fields, but also for more efficient querying when account data should be retrieved.\nAccounts in the UI\nUsers should not choose user accounts from a list of account IDs. User lists and references should be displayed in the UI using the username and provenance fields. Username only is no longer sufficient, as the user may need to distinguish between similarly named accounts in different systems.\nAccount References in APIs\nBased on how existing APIs and documents are structured, user account IDs and username/provenance pairs should be accepted and returned by APIs. In the cases where account IDs are exposed, they should appear as strings in JSON, and the APIs should then assume the burden of validating IDs, converting them to\nObjectId\nwhere appropriate, and testing for equality using the appropriate methods.\nQuery, Filter and Sort Account Documents\nExample Account Document\nWith the MongoDB aggregation pipeline as a framework, let's presume the following account document exists.\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5aebd2fae2c5b5614927362b\"),\n    \"provenance\" : \"Local AAA\",\n    \"username\" : \"admin@pronghorn\",\n    \"firstname\" : \"admin\",\n    \"memberOf\" : [ ... ],\n    \"assignedRoles\" : [ ... ],\n    \"lastLogin\" : ISODate(\"2018-05-30T16:29:39.944Z\"),\n    ...,\n}\nQuery Documents with Referenced Accounts\nDenormalization of user account data, e.g., keeping a copy of the username alongside the account ID, creates a maintenance issue in cases where the account data has changed, but your copy has not. This is not a good practice and is discouraged. Instead, load the account data at query time in order to include it in the API response.\nExample Workflow\n{\n    \"_id\": \"b6517ac9-a8fc-4621-902b-174458005c90\",\n    \"name\": \"Example

The endpoint behind the configuration dialog has been corrected to return task methods, enabling comprehensive configuration of custom roles.\nENG-9045\nEnhancements have been made to logging and error checking processes during Redis initialization, improving overall reliability and troubleshooting capabilities.\nENG-10364\nA problem was identified where projects containing workflows with a\ncreatedBy\nfield would fail to import. This issue has been rectified by removing the\ncreatedBy\nfield during the import process.\nENG-10673\nUpdated the\nrodeo-ui\nversion to resolve a bug issue where the\n/myTtl\nAPI endpoint was being unnecessarily triggered multiple times when the Logout Warning Dialog was displayed.\nENG-10721\nAn issue was resolved where Projects larger than 2MB would encounter errors when pulled from a Github repository. This issue has been corrected to ensure smoother Project management.\nENG-10753\nResolved calculation errors in\nnextRunAt\nfor schedule triggers that occurred under specific creation circumstances, ensuring that\nnextRunAt\nis now calculated accurately.\nENG-10757\nRestored support for using symlink with custom apps and adapters.\nENG-10758\nCorrected the method by which the PHSpinner component was setting its current and default values in the UI.\nENG-10784\nA critical issue was fixed where starting a job would fail to validate the workflow correctly. Instead, it relied on outdated error data from the workflow document to determine if the job could start. This issue has been corrected to ensure proper validation.\nENG-11370\nWhen the profile document serves as the source for the\nservices\nconfiguration property, a new service can now be added to the Platform, which will spin up the service during the first startup rather than only upon restart. This regression from version 2023.2 has been resolved for Platform 6.\nENG-11399\nA fix has been applied to address an issue where revert transitions initiated from within a\nforEach\nloop could unexpectedly terminate the loop prematurely, causing disruptions in the intended logic.\nENG-11602\nAn issue was resolved where Operations Manager Automations lost the referenced Project name from the imported Project. This issue has been corrected to ensure proper functionality.\nENG-11641\nA bug was fixed that prevented users from successfully logging in when utilizing the LDAP authentication method with custom groups.\nENG-11692\nUpon import, valid functions were deselected from the transformation when opened and saved, and the transformation did not work as expected when running it in JST Designer. Updated the\ncheckType\nparameter in the function check logic. Imported transformations now retain their selected functions on import, and are no longer empty.\nENG-11872\nA critical fix was implemented to the Node version health check, which now ensures that the post-merge pipeline can successfully pass without any hindrance.\nENG-11901\nThe\n/health/status\nendpoint, used to ping downstream services when performing a health check, caused timeouts when used with a readiness probe. Added a new optional query parameter\nexclude-services\nso that the endpoint only returns health information related to the Platform itself, and not the health of its connections to downstream systems.\nImprovements\nThis section highlights quality improvements to Itential Platform's functionality in this maintenance release.\nKey ID\nRelease Note\nENG-11313\nSupport has been added for configurable\nserverId\nstrategies, including a new strategy for generating a random UUID as the\nserverId\n. This improvement allows for greater flexibility in server identification.\nENG-11314\nIntroduced a new\n/.well-known/auth-metadata\nendpoint to support AAA providers in retrieving relevant metadata while users are unauthenticated. This update, along with enhancements to the Azure AAA adapter, allows the Platform to dynamically set the client and tenant IDs on the SSO login page, significantly improving the user experience.\nENG-11418\nTask events have been added to the Workflow Engine, which significantly improves the auditing capabilities of job processing, allowing for better tracking and management of tasks.\nENG-11516\nImplemented custom job and task variable support in the Gateway Manager\nrunService\ntask. This task enhances the functionality of Gateway Manager, allowing users to select the service type and gateway cluster, and use variable options for cluster and service inputs.\nENG-11700\nThe Gateway Manager option has been relocated to the Administration section of the Itential Platform sidebar. This UI change is accompanied by a new icon for better visibility and user experience.\nSecurity Changes\nThis section highlights fixes and measures to prevent and minimize security risks and vulnerabilities.\nKey ID\nRelease Note\nENG-10283\nDuring security scans, it was discovered that certain versions of the\nundici\npackage in Admin Essentials were vulnerable to Insecure Randomness risks.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/accessibility-iap", "title": "Accessibility", "text": "Accessibility\nUpdated on\nJan 21, 2025\nPublished on May 20, 2023\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nOverview\nMaking Itential Platform accessible means making it usable by everyone and making it possible for everyone to seamlessly connect their IT systems with network technologies for end-to-end network configuration, compliance, and automation.\nThis guide provides accessibility information about the Platform user interface (UI) elements along with information about views and controls that are intuitive and scalable. For simplicity, these guidelines are presented herein as UI/UX checklists to verify key accessibility requirements are met in the design and implementation of the Platform.\nProcess and UI Framework\nItential has built a set of guidelines to follow when creating user interfaces and designs for the Platform. These guidelines aim at targeting WCAG 2.1 conformance (as recommended by\nW3C\n).\nCompliance with WCAG 2 is managed primarily through the RodeoUI library, which controls color, font properties, and other visual details.\nRodeo is built on\nPrime React\n, which claims to be fully accessible and in compliance with Section 508 standards.\nThe Itential Style Guide,\nFlavor\n, provides an overview of all UI elements and guidelines for building interfaces with the RodeoUI library.\nSpecific app designs are based on the\nFlavor\nstyle guide and\nPrime React\ncomponent library.\nInformal accessibility audits of live applications are performed pre-release by the Itential Testing & Verification team.\nVisual Accessibility\nAccessibility begins with design. The following standards are met by all UI components and patterns in\nFigma\n, a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool used at Itential to design and build the Itential Platform.\nThe AA (ideal) level of conformance is the standard for body text compared to background color. For contrast testing,\nColor Review\nis used to test compliance.\nError, warning, and success states must use icons along with text and color. For colorblind and grayscale testing, the\nColor Oracle\nsimulator is used.\nText style properties (minimum requirements) are:\nFont size to at least 14px.\nText enlargement not to exceed 200% (font magnification, not browser zoom).\nLine height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size.\nParagraph spacing to at least 2 times the font size.\nLetter spacing to at least 0.12 times the font size.\nWord spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.\nFunctional Accessibility\nEvery functional test requirement references a WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion target.\nA\nproject checklist\nis used to cover most of the\nWCAG\nrequirements for accessibility and compliance.\nAccessibility is tested across four major browsers: IE11, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox.\nWhere possible, built-in accessibility checkers are used to inspect a page. For example, in Chrome, select Audit ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Generate Report.\nIf a page is rendered without CSS, it should still be in a logical order and navigable.\nKeyboard Control (No Mouse)\nItential users can use their keyboard like a mouse to navigate and interact with items onscreen.\nIf it can be clicked, selected, or modified (on input) it must be available from the keyboard (tabbing).\nFor drag and drop functionality, a keyboard-based cut and paste alternative can be offered, or a separate UI for accessibility can be enabled.\nNo keyboard traps. User must always be able to leave a component with the keyboard.\nTabbing must be in a logical top-down, left-right order. A tab-index is used to enforce a certain tabbing order, where needed.\nIf a button or link triggers a dialog or modal window, when the user closes the dialog, they should not be forced back to the top of the page. The element that had focus when the dialog was launched should regain focus when the dialog is closed.\nKeyboard arrows do not trigger an event or function.\nElements with focus have clear visible focus indication.\nWhen an element receives focus, no unexpected action is triggered.\nSelecting or changing a checkbox, radio button, or toggle does not trigger unexpected changes in page context or content.\nThe table below presents a list of keyboard shortcuts and best practices for assistive technologies and accessibility.\nPress this\nTo do this\nEnter\nClick to action\nSpacebar\nToggle\nChoose an item\nOpen a dropdown\nTab\nNavigate in a logical pattern\nKeyboard Arrows\nNavigate inside a dropdown or container\nScreen Reader\nScreen reader is the interface that specifically works within browsers to read content aloud for blind and low vision individuals.\nGives ability for user to pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or auto-updating content.\nDoes not use color as a visual means to convey information - must use icon and text.\nAll Form elements have labels, and labels use the\n<label-for>\nhtml attribute to link a label to an input.\nOffers a \"skip to main content\" button on UIs for screen readers to offer the user a chance to bypass headers and navigation elements that are repeated on every page.\nThe\n<label-for>\nhtml attribute to link a label to an input can be hidden using CSS so it is only visible to the screen reader, but\nDo Not Use\nvisibility:hidden\nor\ndisplay:none\nto hide the link.\nEach page has a title clearly describing the topic or purpose of that page.\nThe\n<title>\ntag in a page header is compliant, and shows page topic in a Browser Tab.\nLinks and buttons that do not have clear text have a title attribute that conveys purpose or target.\nAll symbols and images have alternative text.\nAll images have a descriptive\nalt\nattribute, or an empty string (\nalt=\"\"\n) if it is a purely decorative image.\nPage language is specified in HTML markup.\nValidation uses clear and explicit language for input errors.\nRequired inputs use a proper attribute.\nSections have status roles using the\n<role=\"\">\nattribute\nARIA is used, where appropriate, to better identify the purpose of UI elements.\nTables have header cells describing either the column that comes below it, or the row that comes after it. As a result, table cells are properly marked with a\n‚Äúscope‚Äù\nattribute so that the screen reader knows how to match the heading to the data.\nReact Specifications\nIn React, the\nfor\nattribute is written as\nhtmlFor\nin JSX.\nSometimes HTML semantics is broken when adding\n<div>\nelements to JSX to make  React code work, especially when working with lists (\n<ol>\n,\n<ul>\nand\n<dl>\n) and the HTML\n<table>\n. In these cases, Itential will use\nReact Fragments\nto group together multiple elements.\nFor example:\nimport React, { Fragment } from 'react';\nfunction ListItem({ item }) { return ( <Fragment><dt>{item.term}</dt> <dd>{item.description}</dd> </Fragment> );\n}\nfunction Glossary(props) { return ( <dl> {props.items.map(item => ( <ListItem item={item} key={item.id} />))} </dl>);\n}\nComponent\nSpecification\nNavSidebar\nMain workspace area requires\nrole=‚Äúmain‚Äù\nSearch\nRequires\nrole=‚Äúsearch‚Äù\nDesign Examples\nThe intent of this section is to show examples of the Itential Platform user interface.\nFigure 1: : Advanced Search and Collections View\nFigure 2: Itential Platform Gen 2 Workflow\nAccessibility at Itential\nThe most important aspects of any user interface are navigation and consistent use of components to predict where things are on each page. Itential dedicates extra attention to these areas to inclusively improve the product experience for all types of users.\nWe welcome your feedback on the accessibility of Itential Platform.

This is an asynchronous function and can only be used to call asynchronous functions.\nAccessing the Pronghorn Class\nAn instantiation of the Pronghorn class is made by Itential Platform on startup.

When a profile is selected for editing, the profile properties are displayed as a form. Detailed information on each profile property is summarized below.\nSee related articles:\nMongoDB Properties\nService Configs\nServer Name & ServerId\nadapterStrategy\nAn adapter strategy can be defined for Itential Platform to show a preference for one southbound system (provider) over another. By setting the\nadapterStrategy\nproperty, an administrator of Itential Platform can better direct how device-bound calls interact with external/southbound systems. Additionally, an exception can be setup for the\nrunCommand\nAPIs and workflow tasks if the order needs to be further controlled.\nNote:\nAny custom adapter that has implemented the device broker methods would come next after the configured preferential order has been exhausted.\nCurrently Supported\nValues\nStrategy Types\ndevice\nAdapter Types\nAutomationGateway\nNSO\nException\nrunCommand\nSample Adapter Strategy Properties\n\"adapterStrategy\" : {\n  \"device\": {\n    \"adapterTypes\": [\n        \"AutomationGateway\",\n        \"NSO\"\n    ],\n    \"exceptions\": {\n        \"runCommand\": \"NSO\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe properties of the\nadapterStrategy\nobject include the type of strategy, and currently\ndevice\nis the only one supported. This object contains two properties:\nadapterTypes\nand\nexceptions\n.\nThe property value for\nadapterTypes\nis an array of strings that are the types of the adapters; however, only\nAutomationGateway\nand\nNSO\nare possible values to be set. Under that section you can set the default order of the provider. In the example above, the calls that are shown in the lists below will prefer\nAutomationGateway\nover\nNSO\n. These names are types of adapters and not names of adapter instances defined by the user such as\nnso45\nor\nnso46\n. If for some reason the preferred provider cannot fulfill the request, Itential Platform will try the next one on the list. Lastly, if a custom adapter implements the device broker, then it will be attempted next. If all adapters have tried to fulfill the request and fail, an error is returned.\nThe\nexceptions\nobject contains key/value pairs that represent specific function level overrides. An exception definition will use the provider value for that function over the preferred provider order defined in\nadapterTypes\n. Currently only\nrunCommand\nis supported.\nOnce this object is configured the way you would like, save the configuration and restart Itential Platform.\n‚ö†\nWARNING\nThese are 'system-wide' properties so multiple calls will be impacted. See the tables below for the specific calls that are affected.\nWhen Itential Platform communicates with its registered providers it will call them in the order defined in the adapter strategy. Based on the example above Itential Platform will call any\nAutomationGateway\nproviders first, then any\nNSO\nproviders, then any providers not listed in the strategy; unless the call is\nrunCommand\nwhere it will call the\nNSO\nprovider first. The strategy ensures the call will return after the first successful provider responds.\nThe following APIs and Workflow tasks will be affected if the\nadapterStrategy\nproperty is set:\nWorkflow Task Name\nAPI Route and Endpoint\nbackUpDevice\nPOST /configuration_manager/devices/backups\ngetDevice\nGET /configuration_manager/devices/:name\ngetDeviceConfig\nGET /configuration_manager/devices/:name/configuration\ngetDeviceConfigFormat\nGET /configuration_manager/devices/:name/configuration/:format\ngetDevicesFiltered\nPOST /configuration_manager/devices\nisAlive\nGET /configuration_manager/devices/:name/isAlive\nlookupDiff\nPUT /configuration_manager/lookup_diff\nrunNodeReport\nGET /golden_config/compliance/node/:tree/:nodeid\nrunReportForDevice\nGET /golden_config/compliance/:treeid/:device\nrunSelectedReport\nGET /golden_config/compliance/:tree/:nodeid/:selected\nrunTreeReport\nGET /golden_config/compliance/tree/:tree\nGetBootFlash\nPOST /mop/GetBootFlash\npassThru\nPOST /mop/passThru/:device\nping\nPOST /mop/ping\nRunCommand\nPOST /mop/RunCommand\nRunTemplateDevice\nPOST /mop/RunTemplateDevice\nRunTemplateDevices\nPOST /mop/RunTemplateDevices\nSetBoot\nPOST /mop/SetBoot\nisAlive\nPOST /nso_manager/isAlive\nliveStatus\nPOST /nso_manager/liveStatus\nDryRunDeletion\nPOST /smart_template/st/dryrun/deletion\nProvisionDeletion\nPOST /smart_template/st/provision/deletion\nProvisionST\nPOST /smart_template/st/provision\ngetDevicesFiltered\nPOST /policy-manager/devices-filtered\nimportPoliciesFromDevice\nPOST /policy-manager/import/device\nimportPoliciesPreview\nPOST /policy-manager/import/preview\npushDryrun\nPOST /policy-manager/device/dryrun\nDryRunWF\nPOST /smart_template/st/dryrunWF\nProvisionWF\nPOST /smart_template/st/provisionWF\nThe following APIs endpoints (e.g. no corresponding workflow task) will be affected if the\nadapterStrategy\nproperty is set:\nAPI Route and Endpoint\nMethod Name\nPOST /configuration_manager/patch_device/:deviceName\npatchDeviceConfiguration\nPOST /golden_config/addNative\naddNativeRules\nGET /golden_config/compare/:device/:tree/:nodeid\ncompareDeviceToLeaf\nGET /mop/devices/:substring\ngetDevicesFiltered\nGET /mop/devices/detailed/:substring\ngetDevicesFilteredDetailedResults\nPOST /mop/RunCommandDevices\nRunCommandDevices\nPOST /mop/RunCommandTemplateSingleCommand\nRunCommandTemplateSingleCommand\nPOST /mop/deviceObjects\ngetDeviceObjectsFiltered\nGET /nso_manager/devices/:substring\ngetDevicesFiltered\nPOST /policy-manager/device/push\npushToDevice\nPOST /smart_template/st/autogenerate\nCreateST\nThe following Workflow tasks (e.g. no corresponding APIs) will be affected if the\nadapterStrategy\nproperty is set:\nWorkflow Task\nApplication\nrunAutoRemediation\nConfiguration Manager\nrunComplianceForDevice\nConfiguration Manager\nrunComplianceForNode\nConfiguration Manager\nrunComplianceForTree\nConfiguration Manager\nAdditionally, the following calls are affected if the\nexceptions\nproperty is set:\nWorkflow Task Name\nAPI Route and Endpoint\nGetBootFlash\nPOST /mop/GetBootFlash\npassThru\nPOST /mop/passThru/:device\nRunCommand\nPOST /mop/RunCommand\nRunTemplateDevice\nPOST /mop/RunTemplateDevice\nRunTemplateDevices\nPOST /mop/RunTemplateDevices\nSetBoot\nPOST /mop/SetBoot\nThe following APIs endpoints (e.g. no corresponding workflow task) will be affected if the\nexceptions\nproperty is set:\nAPI Route and Endpoint\nMethod Name\nPOST /mop/RunCommandDevices\nRunCommandDevices\nPOST /mop/RunCommandTemplateSingleCommand\nRunCommandTemplateSingleCommand\nImportant:\nAll the calls above are affected by the\nadapterStrategy\nproperty setting.

In Linux, only\nroot\nor\nsetuid\napplications can bind to ports below 1024. Please refer to\nPrivileged Ports\nto learn more on running services at specific ports.\nTo workaround this limitation and run Itential Platform over port 443, it will require setting\nHAProxy\nto listen on 443 and forward to localhost 3443.\nloggerProps\nThe logger properties control where Itential Platform will store its log files, how much space to dedicate to log storage, and the verbosity levels of the log messages that will be stored. Itential Platform supports the following log levels.\nLog Level\nDescription\nerror\nThe most severe level. Indicates a problem, such as a prematurely terminated program.\nwarn\nUsed for warning conditions. Warn events may or may not indicate a problem.\ninfo\nUsed for informational messages.\ndebug\nUsed only when debugging problems or transactions. Provides detailed information on messages between Itential Platform adapters and external systems.\ntrace\nTrace events have a higher verbosity than debug. Trace events are uncommon.\nspam\nThe least severe level. Spam events have the highest verbosity and are rare.\nProduction environments should run at either warn or info level. Running production environments in debug or trace levels will likely generate a large amount of log data and place additional load on the server. A production server should only be configured in debug mode at the request of the Itential Support.\nItential Platform provides native support for rotation of the\npronghorn.log\nfile. Administrators can define the total allocated storage for logs by configuring the maximum file size and maximum number of files. For example, if the maximum file size is 1 MB and the total number of files is 100, the total space consumed by\npronghorn.log\nfiles will be 100 MB. Be sure the disk that holds the Itential Platform logs contains enough space for Itential Platform to exercise a full log rotation cycle (100 MB).\nThe log levels for each application and adapter are configurable at run-time using the Itential Platform UI. When the server is restarted, the log levels for all applications and adapters is returned to the defaults provided by the\nlog_level\nand\nconsole_level\nproperties.\nItential Platform allows for the verbosity of its console logging to be configured. For\nsystemd\nbased operating systems, this console logging is controlled by the system journal. The system journal may contain application life cycle error messages that are not capable of being written to the\npronghorn.log\nfile itself. The system journal should be reviewed for errors and warnings during any troubleshooting sessions. The system journal is also written to\n/var/log/messages\non many systems. The storage required to store the system journal and\n/var/log/messages\nfiles should also be considered during the storage planning phases.\nUse the following command to monitor the system journal.\njournalctl -f\nUse the\npronghorn.service\nunit to tail the system journal and filter only Itential Platform messages.\njournalctl -f -u pronghorn.service\nFor more details about configuring the system journal daemon and using the\njournalctl\ncommand, see the official Red Hat documentation:\nUsing the Journal\n.\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\ndescription\nString\nLogging\nThe description property.\nlog_directory\nString\n/var/log/pronghorn\nThe directory to store Itential Platform log files.\nlog_filename\nString\npronghorn.log\nThe name of the current Itential Platform log file.\nlog_max_file_size\nNumber\n1048576\nThe maximum size of each Itential Platform log file in bytes. Once the maximum file size is reached, the Itential Platform log will be rotated.\nlog_max_files\nNumber\n100\nThe maximum number of log files maintained on the server. Once the maximum number of files is reached, the oldest file will be deleted during log rotation.\nlog_timezone_offset\nNumber\n0\nThe offset from GMT/UTC time that will be used when writing to the log files. Valid values are whole numbers ranging from -12-12 as is listed in\nList of UTC time offsets\n.\nlog_level\nString\ninfo\nThe verbosity level the server is configured to log messages to the Itential Platform log. This can be one of the following: error, warn, info, debug, trace or spam. As a recommendation, run production servers at info level logging.\nconsole_level\nString\nwarn\nThe verbosity level the server is configured to log messages to the system journal or\n/var/log/messages\n. This can be one of the following: error, warn, info, debug, trace or spam. The verbosity of the Itential Platform log and the system journal may be adjusted independently.\nmetrics_filename\nString\nmetrics.log\nThe name of the metrics log file inside the WorkflowEngine metrics directory.\nNote:\nThis is a metrics logging specific property, that currently only pertains to Job Metrics.\nmetrics_max_files\nNumber\n31\nThe max number of allowed log files inside the WorkflowEngine metrics directory for retention before deleting the oldest files when a rotation occurs.\nNote:\nThis is a metrics logging specific property, that currently only pertains to Job Metrics.\nmetrics_rotation_interval\nString\n7d\nThe maximum amount of time between metrics file rotations, before a file rotation occurs.

To configure the number of times Itential Platform will attempt to retry a failed service, set the\nmaxRetries\nproperty. When the number of times Itential Platform restarts a service exceeds the maxiumum number allowed in\nmaxRetries\n, all attempts to restart the service will stop. The count will then reset if the number of milliseconds configured within the\nretryResetTimer\nproperty has elapsed between any two retry attempts.\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\nmaxRetries\nInteger\n10\nMaximum number of retries for a service to fail before Itential Platform will no longer attempt to restart it.\nretryResetTimer\nInteger\n60000\nAmount of time (ms) between each retry before the count (see\nmaxRetries\n) will reset.\nSample Retry Strategy Properties\n\"retryStrategy\" : {\n  \"maxRetries\": 15,\n  \"retryResetTimer\": 2500\n}\nCare should be taken when configuring each of these properties as they work together to achieve the best retry strategy. For instance,\nretryResetTimer\ncan be configured to account for occasional crashes (even expected daily crashes) by having the counter reset after a short period to avoid reaching the\nmaxRetries\nthreshold for retry activity to stop.\nsystemProps\nThe following table presents the\nsystemProps\nthat may be configured.\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\nlaunchDelay\nNumber\n0\nThe time in seconds the Itential Platform will wait between launching its services.

Default: 3 missed health checks\nMinimum: 1\ndeadProcessCheck\nBoolean\nfalse\nIf true, Itential Platform will perform a health check on its services in timed intervals set by the\ndeadProcessCheckInterval\n. If a process is considered dead it will be restarted.\ndeadProcessCheckInterval\nNumber\n5\nThe interval in seconds the Itential Platform will check the health of its services. This check interval works in conjunction with\ndeadProcessMaxPeriod\nto define when Itential Platform considers the service lost.\ndeadProcessMaxPeriod\nNumber\n15\nThe threshold in seconds after which Itential Platform considers a service lost if it has not received a health update. At each check interval (see\ndeadProcessCheckInterval\n), if the last received healthcheck for this service is longer than the\ndeadProcessMaxPeriod\n, then Itential Platform will then consider the service lost.\nIMPORTANT: The longest interval a service can be down before being caught is the sum of\ndeadProcessMaxPeriod\nand\ndeadProcessCheckInterval\n. In other words, with the defaults supplied herein, it might be 20 seconds before a service is detected to be down due to the time lag of the check interval when compared against this threshold. Keep this in mind if you modify these settings.\nexternalRequestTimeout\nNumber\n5\nThe timeout for external API requests. Measured in seconds. Minimum: 1\nMaximum: 120\ndeviceCountPollingInterval\nNumber\n24\nThe interval for how often Itential Platform polls for the number of devices. Measured in hours. Minimum: 1\nMaximum: 168\nservicesBlacklist\nArray\n[]\nA list of service types that will be \"blacklisted\" for the current user. This means the user will not be able to perform CRUD (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) operations on any of the services configured within the system that have the listed service type in this property. Only the\nadmin\nuser will be able to configure these service types. For example, if an admin would like to prevent all users of the system from modifying the AAA adapter then they can do so by specifying \"LDAP\" (if LDAP is the configured AAA system) within the\nservicesBlacklist\nproperty. Remember the values in the\nservicesBlacklist\nproperty are the\nservice type\n. To find this value, navigate to the service config (e.g. Adapter Configuration) and look for the \"properties\" array and the \"type\" value for the targeted service. Use the value of \"type\" and remember that all adapters of this type will be restricted; in other words, it restricts by type and not by instance.\nshutdownTimeout\nNumber\n3\nThe time (seconds) Itential Platform waits before it shuts down its services. This allows a service to have some time to perform any operations it may need to do before it exits. This timeout also applies to the service life-cycle actions \"stop\", \"restart\", and \"crashes\". If a service completes its cleanup operations before the timeout, it will exit. During a system wide shutdown, all services will stay active until every service has completed their cleanup operations. If operations are completed before the timeout, the platform will exit. If for some reason a service is unable to complete its cleanup operations within the specified shutdown timeout, it will be forcibly closed and a message written to the logs indicating the name of the service that incurred the timeout, and then the platform will exit.\nSample System Properties\nBelow is a sample\nsystemProps\nconfiguration when used with the\nAdvanced Mode\neditor.\n\"systemProps\": {\n  \"launchDelay\": 0,\n  \"launchTimeout\": 60,\n  \"serviceHealthCheckInterval\": 5,\n  \"serviceHealthCheckUnhealthyThreshold\": 3,\n  \"deadProcessCheck\": false,\n  \"deadProcessCheckInterval\": 5,\n  \"deadProcessMaxPeriod\": 15,\n  \"externalRequestTimeout\": 5,\n  \"deviceCountPollingInterval\": 24,\n  \"servicesBlacklist\": [ \"NSO\", \"local_aaa\", \"GitHub:v5\" ],\n  \"shutdownTimeout\": 3\n}\nuiProps\nÔÅö\nThis profile property applies to legacy versions of Itential Platform (2023.2 and earlier).\nThe UI properties is captured by the\nuiProps\nobject.

The following high-level strategy minimizes downtime, maximizes efficiency, and helps prevent service level agreement (SLA) breaches.\nBackup strategy\nItential recommends these backup practices:\nPerform a daily\nmongodump\nto capture all database data once per day\nTake hourly snapshots of the jobs and tasks collections to capture automation results throughout the day\nRetain backups for no longer than seven days, as backup files can become large\nNote\nYou can capture hourly snapshots in binary format or JSON format. However, Itential prefers binary format and recommends using binary whenever possible.\nIdentify critical directories and files\nYou need current configuration and data files for restoration. Ensure you identify and backup these files. The following locations are defaults and might vary in your installation:\nFile type\nLocation\nDescription\nConfiguration files\n/etc/mongod.conf\nMain configuration\nSecurity and authentication files\n/etc/ssl/certs/mongo\nTLS certificates and keys\nSecurity and authentication files\n/etc/ssl/\nAdditional security files\nData directory\n/var/lib/mongo\nDatabase files\nBack up MongoDB data\nYou can only export and import from the primary MongoDB server in the replica set. Connect to the primary server, then use\nmongoexport\nor\nmongodump\nto export content to the appropriate directory. Move the data to the target server.

MongoDB does this automatically by controlling the member's state. However, you can manually control whether a member can become primary by setting the priority.\nMember states\nIf you add a new member to a replica set, or if an existing member has been out of service for an extended period, MongoDB initiates a series of steps to bring that member in line with the existing members. MongoDB achieves this by controlling the member's state to reflect its status within the set.\nSTARTUP\nEach replica set member starts in this state\nmongod\nloads the member's replica set configuration and transitions the member's state to\nSTARTUP2\nMembers can't vote and aren't recognized as replica set members yet\nSTARTUP2\nMembers enter this state after\nmongod\nfinishes loading the configuration\nThe member becomes an active replica set member\nIf the member begins initial sync, it remains in\nSTARTUP2\nuntil all data is copied and all indexes are built\nThe member then transitions to\nRECOVERING\nRECOVERING\nMembers aren't ready to accept reads\nThis state can occur during normal operation and doesn't indicate an error\nMembers can vote in elections but can't become primary\nMembers transition to\nSECONDARY\nafter replicating enough data for consistent client reads\nThe only difference between\nRECOVERING\nand\nSECONDARY\nstates is that\nRECOVERING\nprohibits client reads and\nSECONDARY\npermits them\nControl member priority\nTo prevent a secondary member from becoming primary during failover, assign it a priority lower than the primary member's priority.\nExample scenario\n: Your current primary is\nm1.example.net\nand you want to make\nm3.example.net\nthe primary. You have a three-member replica set with the following configuration:\n{\n  \"_id\" : \"rs0\",\n  \"version\" : 7,\n  \"members\" : [\n    {\n      \"_id\" : 0,\n      \"host\" : \"m1.example.net:27017\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"_id\" : 1,\n      \"host\" : \"m2.example.net:27017\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"_id\" : 2,\n      \"host\" : \"m3.example.net:27017\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nTo make\nm3.example.net\nthe primary:\nIn a mongo shell connected to the primary, run the following sequence of operations:\ncfg = rs.conf();\ncfg.members[0].priority = 5;\ncfg.members[1].priority = 5;\ncfg.members[2].priority = 10;\nrs.reconfig(cfg);\nThe following sequence occurs:\nm3.example.net\nand\nm2.example.net\nsync with\nm1.example.net\n(typically within 10 seconds)\nm1.example.net\nsees it no longer has the highest priority and steps down\nIf\nm3.example.net\n's sync is far behind,\nm1.example.net\nwaits until\nm3.example.net\nis within 10 seconds of its optime before stepping down\nThe step down forces an election where\nm3.example.net\nbecomes primary based on its priority setting\nComplete the restoration\nUse the appropriate restore command based on your backup method:\nRestore from binary format\nIf you used\nmongodump\nto create the backup, use\nmongorestore\nto restore it:\nmongorestore --ssl --drop --uri='mongodb://admin:<password>@<mongo-host-1>:27017,<mongo-host-2>:27017,<mongo-host-3>:27017/itential?replicaSet=rs0&authSource=admin' dump/itential\nRestore from JSON format\nIf you used\nmongoexport\nto create the backup, use\nmongoimport\nto restore it:\nmongoimport --ssl --db=itential --collection=workflows --file=workflows/workflows.json --uri='mongodb://admin:<password>@<mongo-host-1>:27017,<mongo-host-2>:27017,<mongo-host-3>:27017/itential?replicaSet=rs0&authSource=admin'\nFor more information, see the\nMongoDB replica set restoration documentation\n.\nNext steps\nAfter completing the backup and recovery process, consider implementing these additional measures:\nSet up automated backup monitoring to ensure backups complete successfully\nTest your recovery procedures regularly to verify they work as expected\nDocument your specific configuration details for future reference\nConsider implementing additional

Itential also supports PingID as an Identity Provider (IdP). This article explains how to set up a SAML SSO between Itential Platform and PingID.\nPrerequisites\nItential assumes the reader has completed the process of setting up SAML SSO Authentication in Itential Platform via Admin Essentials, and has mapped their Identity Provider (Itential Platform ‚Üí Admin Essentials ‚Üí Authorization ‚Üí Identity Providers).\nPlease keep in mind that each organization may have their PingID system configured differently and this guide is not all-inclusive of every system environment.\nA basic guide to configuring PingID as a SAML Identity Provider (IdP) is available on the Ping Identity site:\nConfiguring a SAML Application\nA short demo of how to setup PingID and a \"test application\" to work with SAML SSO is shown in this resource video:\nAdding PingID Attributes\nWhen configuring an Identity Provider (\"IdP\") in the\nItential Platform\n, you will need to enter an Entity ID (called the \"Issuer\") that identifies the identity provider.\nSign in to\nPingID\nand go to the Itential Platform application that was setup under\nApplications\n.\nUnder\nSAML Configuration\ncopy the\nEntity ID\n(Figure 1).

This will be used to satisfy the\nLogin URL\nparameter on the Itential Platform\nIdentity Providers ‚Üí Configuration\nform (Figure 4).\nDownload the\nSigning Certificate\nfile from the\nPingID\nadministrative console (Applications ‚Üí Configuration tab) and then upload the certificate file to the\nIdentity Providers ‚Üí Configuration\nform by drag-and-drop, or use the\nClick to Browse\nlink to find and select the file to upload (Figure 4).\nFigure 3: PingID Single Signon Service Key & Signing Certificate\nFigure 4: Itential Platform IdP Login URL & Certificate Upload\nIn the\nPingID\nadministrative console, go to the Applications ‚Üí\nAttribute Mappings\ntab and copy the Username, Group Names, and Email Addresses under the\nPingOne\ncolumn (Figure 5).\nIn\nItential Platform\n, on the Identity Providers ‚Üí\nConfiguration\ntab, paste the PingID:\nUsername\nin the\nUsername Attribute\nfield\nGroup Names\nin the\nGroups Attribute\nfield\nEmail Addresses\nin the\nEmail Attribute\nfield\nFigure 5: PingID Attribute Mappings\nFigure 6: Itential Platform IdP Attribute Fields\nClick the\nSave\nbutton at the top of the\nIdentity Providers\npage (next to Test Connection) to retain all your inputs (Figure 6).\nTesting the PingID Configuration\nTo enable PingID in Itential Platform, you will need to test the config. You can initiate testing by clicking the\nTest Connection\nbutton at the top of the Identity Providers page (under the Configuration tab name). This will initiate SSO SAML authentication with PingID in a new tab and a message will display to indicate if testing is successful or not.\nIf the message indicates a successful test connection, then all parameters are set correctly and you can close the tab. With a successful test connection, you should have Groups showing from the Authentication Server that you can map to Itential Platform. You will want to map at least the\npronghorn\nadmin group to give permissions within Itential Platform.\nFigure 7: Successful Test Message\nIf you receive an unsuccessful message, there might be a problem with the parameters or certificate that was provided. Check your configured SAML settings to verify all attributes are mapped correctly.\nFigure 8: Unsuccessful Test Message\nEnabling PingID SSO\nLastly, you will need to enable PingID SAML to direct users to use SSO to login. The PingID IdP is disabled by default.\nNavigate to the\nIdentity Providers\nlist view (Itential Platform ‚Üí Admin Essentials ‚Üí Authorization ‚Üí Identity Providers). Locate the IdP (PingID) and slide the toggle switch to activate as\nEnabled\n.

This property was introduced in adapter-ldap version 2.11.0.\nbaseGroupDN\nString\nou=groups,o=support,dc=itential,dc=io\nThe base DN from which the LDAP adapter will search for groups. If not provided,\nbaseDN\nis used.  This property was introduced in adapter-ldap version 2.11.0.\ngroupSearchFilter\nString\n(objectClass=groupOfNames)\nFilter for the group search. For each group returned by this filter, a corresponding group is created in Itential Platform.  Because of this, the scope of this filter should be defined such that it only returns groups desired for use in Itential Platform.\nFailure to do so may result in significant performance issues.\nThis property uses the official\nLDAP Search Filter Syntax\n. Be aware that whitespaces between attribute assertions cannot be used. Examples are shown\nbelow\n.\nuserSearchFilter\nString\nsAMAccountName\nuid\nFilter for the user search. This defines the common name (or other object) that defines users in the LDAP server. For example, most Active Directory implementations use\nsAMAccountName\nto define users. Utilize\nuid\nfor OpenLDAP.\nuserMembershipAttribute\nString\nmemberOf\nThis field should contain the name of the LDAP attribute on the user object that indicates which group the user is a member of.\nhealthCheckInterval\nNumber\n5000\nSet interval to ping the LDAP server to ensure connectivity.

The duplicate project checks have been updated to accurately identify duplicate projects that are not accessible by the current user, thereby improving the user experience.\nENG-9372\nA bug was fixed where groups and roles that were added to a custom group using the create group API were not accurately reflected for users in the new group. This fix ensures that the user permissions and roles are correctly assigned and displayed.\nENG-9757\nAn issue was resolved where adapters that were in a\nDEGRADED\nstatus did not automatically revert to\nOnline\nstatus upon restoration of connection. A code fix has been implemented to facilitate automatic recovery from the degraded state, ensuring a seamless transition back to normal operational status.\nENG-10245\nA defect was fixed in the migration scripts for Itential Platform Profiles. Previously, default values were being added, which did not align with the updated requirements for new Profiles that no longer necessitate any values. This fix ensures the migration process aligns with the updated requirements.\nENG-10692\nA bug was identified where attempting to access a child job via the Operations Manager UI using the right-click menu for the task resulted in a 404 error. This issue has been resolved, and now clicking the \"Open\" button will successfully navigate to the intended child job without any errors.\nENG-10795\nAn issue was resolved where stopping the Task Worker negatively impacted the ability to manage scheduled tasks on an instance. This issue persisted until the instance was restarted. The fix ensures that the scheduled tasks can be handled without requiring a restart after stopping the Task Worker.\nENG-10897\nIn rare instances during the shutdown process, the Platform had the potential to log Redis credentials inadvertently. A fix has been successfully implemented to prevent this from occurring, thereby enhancing security and protecting sensitive information.\nENG-11035\nAn issue was discovered that allowed users to inadvertently input an invalid ID into the UpdateForm API, which caused\napp-json_forms\nto unexpectedly stop working. This problem has been resolved through the implementation of input validation measures, ensuring that such invalid entries are no longer possible.\nENG-11131\nIn scenarios where numerous adapters have been installed, users may experience a freezing issue when attempting to add tasks to a workflow. To address this concern, significant enhancements have been implemented in the workflow rendering process, which has resulted in significant performance improvement when a task is added to the workflow.\nImprovements\nThis section highlights quality improvements to Itential Platform's functionality in this maintenance release.\nKey ID\nRelease Note\nENG-9923\nEnhancements have been made to the examples used in the documentation for the\n/workflow_builder/\nAPI endpoint. These improvements provide clearer guidance and facilitate a better understanding for users, ultimately leading to a more effective use of the API.\nENG-10754\nThe system now ensures that valid form data within triggers remains persistent even after updates are made to the corresponding JSON form. This enhancement bolsters data integrity and significantly improves user workflow efficiency.\nENG-10787\nA new dialog feature has been introduced that prompts users to enter a unique name when duplicating a project, thereby improving the user experience and ensuring clarity when naming projects.\nSecurity Changes\nThis section highlights fixes and measures to prevent and minimize security risks and vulnerabilities.\nKey ID\nRelease Note\nENG-10623\nWhen running security scans, it showed affected versions of the\nbody-parser\nlibrary in Pronghorn Core were vulnerable to Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification) risks. Upgraded the package dependency to 1.20.3 to resolve this vulnerability.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Platform 6.0.3 Maintenance Release"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Release Notes"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Bug Fixes"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Improvements"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Security Changes"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-604-maintenance-release", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-602-patch-release-itential-platform"]}

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/adapters-vs-integrations-best-practices", "title": "Adapters vs. Integrations", "text": "Adapters vs. Integrations\nUpdated on\nJan 21, 2025\nPublished on Aug 11, 2023\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nOverview\nItential‚Äôs automation products not only unify network operations across multiple systems, but they also give a tremendous market advantage to accelerate next-generation, agile networks while maintaining existing infrastructure. Itential‚Äôs signature platform for NetDevOps, Itential Platform, offers a low-code solution suite for solving today‚Äôs modern network configuration and compliance requirements.\nAlongside Itential Platform is the Itential Automation Gateway (IAG), a stand-alone integration to popular network automation tools such as Ansible, Terraform and Nornir. For a standardized way to rapidly connect the various protocols required by application vendors, Itential offers two types of resources:\nadapters\nand\nintegrations\n.\nThis best practice guide will help you to understand the use cases for adapters and integrations at Itential. We will begin with an articulation of what adapters and integrations are. From there, we will explore the use cases and strengths of each so you can choose the right path and utilize the best of what Itential has to offer for any given situation.\nThe Evolution of Itential Adapters & Integrations\nAdapters in Itential were first developed in 2015, and presently there exists over 200 different kinds of open-source adapters. Their primary purpose is to integrate Itential Platform with other network applications and systems.\nThrough Itential‚Äôs evolution, integration models were introduced in December 2020 as a lighter-weight, faster way to integrate external systems. Integration models are better suited for certain use cases where we have\nOpenAPI 3.0\nor\nSwagger 2.0\navailable.\nNext, let‚Äôs explore the specific strengths and differences of adapters versus integrations so that you can choose the right tool for your needs.\nBuilding Adapters & Integrations\nAdapters\nare\ncode-driven\n. Apart from 200 opensource adapters, if you need to build new adapters, you can use the\nAdapter Builder\n. Adapter Builder requires OpenAPI 3.0 or Swagger 2.0 documentation to generate the adapter and the user then places the automatically generated node.js onto the file system. This allows a high degree of customization available to suit the user‚Äôs needs.\nIntegrations\nare\nmodel-driven\nand simply require understanding of the desired API calls.  Since they are lightweight, they are not placed on the file system. To build an integration, first, you‚Äôll upload the OpenAPI 3.0 or Swagger 2.0 document via the UI, and this automatically creates the Integration Model (stored in a MongoDB Collection). There is an option to validate the document before creating the integration.\nDeployment\nTo deploy adapters, you will first need to copy the code into the Itential Platform file system. From there, run\nnpm install\nand then restart the  Itential Platform server to start using the adapter. If there are multiple  Itential Platform servers in your infrastructure, then either follow the same steps to upload the adapter code and run the\nnpm install\non each  Itential Platform server or copy the adapter with\nnpm folder\nand restart the server. For Itential cloud infrastructure, the opensource adapters are already available.\nFor integration models, there is no need to restart the  Itential Platform server because the deployment is UI-based. A benefit of using the Integrations Model is that in an infrastructure with multiple  Itential Platform servers, all the servers sync up automatically upon deployment.\nCustomization\nAdapters can be customized according to the needs of the API calls, whereas integrations cannot be customized. Adapters are flexible enough to add or update the API calls whereas integrations are limited to the specification document.\nFor example, if the result of an API call is this:\nYou can customize the adapter call to just return the result as\n‚Äústatus.result.data‚Äù\n, but using an integration you have to deal with the entire status.\nMemory & CPU (Resources)\nIntegrations can be multi-process and not file system based. They do not use any system resources when idle, and they use less resources than adapters while in-use given that they are multi-process. Integrations can scale up on demand.\nAdapters, on the other hand, are single processes. These are file system based and they hold a PID (Process ID) that uses memory (~130 MB per adapter instance) even when idle. When you run multiple tasks, adapters use more memory and CPU than integration models.\nSupported Protocols\nAdapters give you more flexibility with SOAP, and they work with the following support protocols: HTTP and gRPC. Integrations, on the other hand, only work with the HTTP (REST, SOAP) protocol.\nAuthentication\nTo communicate with external systems, adapters and integrations need to be able to authenticate with the external system.\nAdapters can be designed to provide support for a variety of authentication standards, such as Basic, OAuth, Static tokens, and other similar methods that do not require manual intervention. Additionally, adapters can accommodate different endpoints for authentication purposes.\nIntegrations support API Key (including AWS), HTTP (Basic) and OAuth2 (only for 2023.1). For integrations, the OpenID Connect scheme is\nnot\ncurrently supported.\nSecurity\nAdapters support SSL whereas Integrations support SSL but only for publicly signed certificates. For self-signed certificates to work with Integrations, the keys need to be manually added to the key store.\nVersion Control\nIn terms of version control, whenever a new version of an adapter is available, the adapter needs to be pulled and the node modules reinstalled. After the update, the adapter must be restarted.\nFor integrations you can have multiple versions and create multiple instances per version. Each instance of an integration is independent, consequently requiring a workflow change in the event of a new integration version being used.\nMigration\nIntegrations are easy to port from one infrastructure to another. For Adapters, one needs to follow the same process as the initial install.\nHealth Checks\nAdapters are equipped with health checks, which do not count as active calls. These health checks can be configured as startup or intermediate. It‚Äôs important to note these health check calls are not considered as active status checks for other systems, but rather operate as timed polls. In contrast, Integrations do not have the capability for health check calls, and therefore, their operational state, such as availability or status, cannot be checked unlike adapters.\nLogs\nAdapters and Integrations both provide multiple levels of logging that includes info, warning, debug, trace, and error. Debug and trace logs are beneficial in troubleshooting, but level should remain warn info in lower environments and error in production.\nUse Cases\nAdapters are used whenever there is a requirement of external system connections using REST, SOAP, gRPC, or to build a wrapper over libraries like Mongo. Adapters also are used when you need to add custom calls and when there is no restriction of system resources (On-Prem).\nIntegrations should be used when an OpenAPI 3.0 document is available and there is no need for any customization. When deploying on a Cloud infrastructure, system resources are limited.\nFeature Comparison\nAdapters and integrations each serve a unique purpose and have different properties that make them suitable for a variety of needs and use cases. For a quick summary of the differences between adapters and integrations, see the table below.\nCategory\nAdapters\nIntegration\nBuild\nVia Adapter Builder\nVia Itential Platform UI\nDeployment\nDeploy as code to each server.\nStored in MongoDB Collection.\nRestart\nRequires full restart at initial deployment.

These configurations are relevant where Redis is running in a virtual machine. However, many of these configurations may also apply to a bare metal installation.\nNo Eviction Policy\nÔÅö\nRelease version 2023.2 and later\nBy default, a\nnoeviction\npolicy is required once the database has reached its memory limit. See the\nRedis Eviction Policy\nsite for more detail.\nAOF Persistence\nÔÅö\nRelease version 2023.2 and later\nFor data durability,\nAOF\n(Append Only File) persistence is required. See the\nRedis Persistence\nsite for more detail.\nMax Memory\nRedis should have the capability to allocate as much memory as it can on the system. More or less is required depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, number of jobs, amount of large items processed within tasks, as well as how often those tasks are run.\nSet the\nmaxmemory\nsetting to at least 80% of the system memory.\nClick here for release versions 2022.1 and 2023.1\nBy default, Redis will consume up to 80% of the memory available on the platform. Set the upper limit to 20% of the available memory so IP may consume the remaining 80%.\nChange the\n# maxmemory <bytes>\nvalue in the\n/etc/redis.conf\nfile.\nRestart Redis to allow the\n/etc/redis.conf\nchanges to go into effect.\nsudo systemctl restart redis\nRedis Memory Errors\nThe\nmaxmemory\nconfiguration for Redis should be set as high as possible. If Itential Platform exceeds this limit, it will cause jobs and tasks to error, as well as other Itential Platform errors to appear as Redis is used for all messaging queues between services. The logged error message is similar to this:\nReplyError: OOM command not allowed when used memory > 'maxmemory'.\nIf this error is found, stop all Itential Platforms to ensure a minimal number of jobs and tasks are affected. After that, check to see what the Redis memory is currently at. In all likelihood, the\nmaxmemory\nconfigured by Redis is not sufficient and needs to be increased. In rare circumstances, however, you may find there is plenty of memory. If that is the case, then you will need to stop all Itential Platform instances and flush what memory remains in Redis.\nFlushing Data (Itential Platform Stopped)\nItential Platform uses Redis for runtime data that is critical for its operation. Performing destructive actions on the Redis database while Itential Platform is running, such as flushing some or all of the Redis data, can put Itential Platform into an unstable state. If for whatever reason this is done by accident, please immediately stop all instances of Itential Platform.\nFlushing Redis data while Itential Platform is running is not supported, and will not be supported.\nHowever, this action is generally safe to do when all Itential Platforms in an instance have been stopped and are no longer running.\nRequirements for Non-Default Users\nIn Redis 6.2 and higher, when authorization is enabled, non-default users must be granted specific permissions to the Redis capabilities used throughout Itential Platform.\nRedis Users\nRedis 6.x has built-in access control, with a single defined user called\ndefault\n(this is the default configuration). You also have the option to configure additional Redis users during installation. Listed below are some suggested examples.\nUsername\nDescription\nadmin\nThe Redis administrative account.\nitential\nThe account used by Itential Platform to connect to Redis.\nrepluser\nThe account used by Redis to perform replication within a Redis cluster.\nsentineluser\nThe account used by Redis Sentinel to connect to Redis.\nUser Rules\nUnder the\nSECURITY\nsection of the\nredis.conf\nfile\n, the user rules should be defined as follows:\nuser default off\n\nuser admin on allkeys allchannels allcommands >admin\n\nuser itential on allkeys allchannels allcommands -asking -cluster -readonly -readwrite -acl|deluser -acl|load -acl|log -acl|list -acl|save -acl|setuser -acl|dryrun -bgrewriteaof -bgsave -config|resetstat -config|rewrite -config|set -failover -flushall -flushdb -psync -replconf -replicaof -save -shutdown -sync >itential\n\nuser repluser on allchannels +psync +replconf +ping >repluser\n\nuser sentineluser on allchannels +multi +slaveof +ping +exec +subscribe +config|rewrite +role +publish +info +client|setname +client|kill +script|kill >sentineluser\nUser Permissions\nThe following table outlines and briefly explains what each\nuser\nline in the rules section above is accomplishing.

Administrators can define the total allocated storage for logs by configuring the maximum file size and maximum number of files. For example, if the maximum file size is 1 MB and the total number of files is 100, the total space consumed by\npronghorn.log\nfiles will be 100 MB. Make sure the disk that holds the pronghorn logs contains enough space for Itential Platform to exercise a full log rotation cycle.\nConsider both the file logs and system logs in Itential Platform when planning server storage requirements.\nSeverity Thresholds\nProduction environments should generally have the\nlog_level\nset to warn or info. Debug, trace, and spam log levels will likely generate a large amount of log data and additional server load. Only configure production servers in debug mode at the request of Itential Support.\nFor\nsystemd\noperating systems, the system journal manages console logging. The system journal may also contain application life cycle error messages that cannot be saved to the Itential Platform file logs.\nTemporal Severity Threshold Settings\nEvery Itential Platform adapter and application inherits the system log and console severity thresholds when Itential Platform starts. After Itential Platform starts, every adapter and application can be optionally configured with local, temporal log and console severity thresholds. The temporal thresholds are reset to Itential Platform global thresholds when Itential Platform restarts.\nNavigate to\nAdmin Essentials\nfrom the Itential Platform homepage.\nClick\nApplications\nor\nAdapters\nfrom the left navbar to open the accordian menu.\nSelect an application (or adapter) and then click the\nLogging\ntab to open the\nLog Settings\nview.\nSet the\nFile Log\nlevel.\nSet the\nConsole Log\nlevel.\nClick the\nSave\nicon to retain your changes. Click the reverse arrow icon to undo all changes.\nFigure 2: Application Logging\nTroubleshooting\nIf a problem prevents Itential Platform from loading the global\nlog\nobject from the\nLogger\nclass, log messages will not reach the Itential Platform log file. Log messages will, however, reach the systemd journal or\n/var/log/messages\non System V (‚ÄúSystem Five‚Äù) hosts.\nMonitor the system journal for errors and warnings using shell command\njournalctl -f\n. If many processes are sending message to the system journal, filter log messages to show only Itential Platform logs using shell command\njournalctl -f -u pronghorn.service\n.\nSee\nRed Hat systemd Journal Documentation\nfor more information.\nMonitor Itential Platform logs with a tail follow shell command, such as\ntail -F /var/log/pronghorn/pronghorn.log\n.\nReading the Logs\nItential Platform logs are JSON objects that are better for automating log parsing operations compared to simple text.\nLog Object Properties\nProperty\nDescription\n@timestamp\nAutomatically added.\n@fields.origin\nThe message location: application that created the log message and its line number associated with the event.\n@fields.level\nThe event message severity level.\n@message\nAn array. Elements can be strings or objects. An array with one string element containing log message text that can be a stack trace, an error received from an external system, or a log message the Itential Platform developer sent with the global\nlog\nobject.\nTroubleshooting a Layered Architecture\nItential Platform applications exist in a layered architecture. Itential Platform has multiple layers, and it is one of many autonomous systems that collectively create network automation. The best way to troubleshooting multiple layers is to establish control and eliminate variables.\nFor example, suppose the application method called from a job task is failing. The task coordinates with an external network controller to affect device changes. Begin by verifying the network controller is able to execute the exact requested action. If the controller has a CLI, that is the best place to verify an action. If the CLI test passes, try calling the action through the controller API. If the controller API test passes, use a web API client, such as Google Postman, to test the Itential Platform application method without the Itential Platform workflow engine. Finally, use the Jobs dashboard to inspect run-time data: passed arguments, data or errors returned.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Event Logs & Logging"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Structure of a Log Message in Itential Platform"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Log Entry Example"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Log Statement"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Log Levels"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Syslog Settings"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Default Log Settings"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Global Log Instance (Developers)"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "JSON Schema Logger Props"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Log File Retention"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Severity Thresholds"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Temporal Severity Threshold Settings"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Troubleshooting"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Reading the Logs"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Troubleshooting a Layered Architecture"}], "code_blocks": ["/var/log/pronghorn/pronghorn.log", "{\n \"@message\": \"[\\\"Cannot register method 'AutomationGateway.deleteInventoryDevice'.

For example, if your Vault server uses an end-user certificate, an intermediate certificate, and a root certificate, the resulting\nvault.cert\nfile should look similar to the following:\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n<Content of end-user certificate>\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n<Content of intermediate certificate>\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n<Content of root certificate>\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\nMove the\nvault.cert\nfile to the\n/etc/pki/tls/certs\ndirectory.\nmv ./vault.cert /etc/pki/tls/certs\nAssign ownership of the\nvault.cert\nfile to the\nitential\nuser.\nchown itential: /etc/pki/tls/certs/vault.cert\nMake sure the\nitential\nuser has read-only access to the\nvault.cert\nfile. No access should be granted to any groups or other users (numeric permission\n400\n).\nchmod 400 /etc/pki/tls/certs/vault.cert\nDetermine the location of the Platform service file\nautomation-platform.service\nby executing the\nsystemctl status automation-platform\ncommand.

Both values are explained below.\nThe first value is\npublic\nwhich allows anyone, regardless of being an Itential Platform user or not, to access the route. This value is the least secure option and should only be used for data that is deemed acceptable for public exposure.\nThe second value is\ntrusted\nwhich allows anyone that is logged into Itential Platform to access the route, regardless of groups or roles. This value is helpful for common methods used by all users which do not have specific authorization controls. For example, the\nGET /whoami\nroute within Itential Platform is required for all users, as it allows them to see information about themselves.

This guide explains how to set indexes and expose your data collections with search objects.\nOnly use this guide to modify custom applications. Do not modify or update the Pronghorn (Itential) applications.\nExposing an Application for Searching\nA database collection may be searched if the collection is exposed with a search object. This search object is added to the\npronghorn.json\nfile and consists of an object, or an array of objects, that follow the schema below.\nSearch Object Attributes\nAttribute\nDescription\nLabel\nThe name of the application that is used when displaying search results. For example: \"Mop Template\" or \"Workflow\".\nCollection\nThe name of the collection to search.\nFields\nAn array of objects containing fields to search.\nName\n: The field name to search.\nType\n: The type of data. Only type \"string\" is supported.\nMap\nAn object that will format the returned data in a specific way.\nName\n: A field name reference. For example, if the title field is exposed to being searched, set the value to \"title\" to return the title value as the name for each result.\nDescription\n:  A field name reference. Can be null, as many database results will not have a description.\nURL\n: The absolute path used for users to access the content they have found. Uses a mustache template system; therefore, field values are available as variables using the mustache syntax {{variable}}. In addition to your exposed field values, you also have access to the\nmongo_id\nfield .\nExamples\nUse the following examples to set the search template and search exposure object.\nEmpty Search Template\n// Place this in pronghorn.json.\n    \"search\": {\n      \"label\": \"YOUR APP NAME\",\n      \"collection\": \"DATABASE COLLECTION NAME\",\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"FIELD TITLE\",\n          \"type\": \"FIELD TYPE (only \"string\" supported currently)\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"map\": {\n        \"name\": \"FIELD REFERENCE NAME\",\n        \"description\": \"FIELD REFERENCE NAME (can be null or empty)\",\n        \"url\": \"/myapp/{{EXAMPLE_VAR}}?myvar={{EXAMPLE_VAR}}\"\n      }\n    },\nSearch Exposure Object\n\"search\": {\n      \"label\": \"Mop\",\n      \"collection\": \"mop_templates\",\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"name\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"map\": {\n        \"name\": \"name\",\n        \"description\": null,\n        \"url\": \"/mop/template?name={{name}}\"\n      }\n    },\nText Only\n- Currently, you can only search on text-based fields (\n\"type\": \"string\"\n). Other types may be supported in the future.\nCreate Index for Exposed Collections\nYou will need to create the proper indexes for your fields to be search enabled. For MongoDB, simple compound indexes are used. You list each field name followed by the number\n1\nas the field value. For more detailed information on creating indexes, refer to:\nMongoDB Method Reference\ndb.collection.createIndex()\n.\nIndex Must Match Fields\n- The compound index must match the fields in the search template. For example, if you want to search on name and type, you must have a compound index on\nname and type.\nTo create an index against a local instance for testing:\nRun the following command in a MongoDB collection browser. This example creates an index on the MOP templates collection for\nname\n. This index will persist to the local database, but if it is dropped it will need to be recreated.\ndb.getCollection('mop_templates').createIndex({ \"name\": 1 }, { background: true });\nNote:\nBe careful when setting indexes and exposing items to search. If done incorrectly, it can have a profound negative impact. To avoid potential issues, adhere to the following guidelines.\nBe careful not to create too many indexes!

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/iag-510", "title": "IAG 5.1.0", "text": "IAG 5.1.0\nUpdated on\nJul 23, 2025\nPublished on Jun 6, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nThis page contains information for new features, improvements, and fixes completed within\nItential Automation Gateway\n5.1 (IAG 5), as well as any other announcements or information that coincide as part of this release.\nIntroducing IAG 5.1\nItential Automation Gateway\n5.1\nrepresents the evolution of IAG 4, introducing new capabilities, simplified deployment, and enhanced scalability for network automation operations.\nNote\nIAG 5.1 follows\nsemantic versioning\n(MAJOR.MINOR.MTCE).\nAs a major version release, IAG 5 introduces significant architectural changes and is not backward compatible with previous IAG versions. However, customers can run IAG 5 alongside existing IAG installations, allowing for gradual adoption of new capabilities.\nWhat's New in IAG 5.1\nIAG 5 introduces the following enhancements:\nModern Architecture\n: Updated architecture and deployment models for enhanced performance and future development\nSimplified Installation\n: Streamlined deployment process compared to previous versions\nCluster Support\n: Enhanced cluster-based deployments with improved load balancing\nService Discovery\n: Automatic discovery and registration of available gateway services\nKickstart Service Creation\n: Import all of the automation scripts within a repository by specifying the --repository flag in your iagctl db import commands\nPyproject.toml Support\n: Support for the modern Python project configuration standard for Python services\nExternal Database Support\n: Use an etcd database or Amazon DynamoDB table as your gateway cluster‚Äôs data store\nDependency Registry Support\n: Use PyPI and Ansible Galaxy registries with your Python and Ansible services\nService Execution Syntax Update\nIAG 5.1 introduces a new syntax for running services that requires the\nservice\nkeyword. This change ensures consistency with other service-related CLI commands.\nExample\n:\niagctl run service python-script hello-iagctl\nThis syntax change affects all service execution commands. Please update your scripts and automation workflows accordingly when migrating to IAG 5.1.\nFor more information, see\niagctl run\n.\nPlatform Integration\nIAG 5 works with\nGateway Manager\nto connect to Itential Platform, enabling IAG 5 services to be used as tasks within Platform workflows.\nDeployment and Compatibility\nIAG 5 supports cluster-based deployments and can run alongside existing IAG installations without conflicts. Gateway Manager is required to connect IAG 5 clusters to Itential Platform.\nSummary\nIAG 5 represents the next generation of Itential's automation gateway technology with enhanced architecture and simplified deployment.

Please note that new features added in various versions of IAG might not be available in all versions of Itential Platform because a specific version of the Platform may lack the functionality to make use of that feature.\nRefer to the following table to identify the IAG versions compatible with Itential Platform versions.\nItential Platform Version\nIAG/2022.1\nIAG/2023.1\nIAG/2023.2\nIAG/2023.3\nIAG/4.3\nIAG/5.1\nItential Cloud - Hosted Version 2023.2 (as of July 15, 2025)\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nPlatform 6.0.0\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n2023.2\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n2023.1\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n2022.1\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nÔÅö\nIf a version of Itential Platform does not provide support for a feature in a version of IAG, the versions remain compatible, but Itential Platform will not be able to use that feature in IAG.\nIAG Versioning Practices\nAll supported versions of IAG are assigned unique identifiers (version numbers) to help manage different versions and releases of the software to ensure customers can access the correct version they need.\nHere's an explanation of how Itential names IAG versions to help you understand the nature of changes between versions:\nComponent Version\n- This identifies the build version of the Platform application (i.e., IAG) distributed in a maintenance release. For each change made to the source code as part of a development build, whether it's a bug fix or improvement, there is a\ncomponent\nversion bump. Components are versioned independently of product release versions. Also, multiple builds can be created for a single\nRelease Version\n.\nRelease Version\n- This identifies the Platform release version of IAG made available to customers in a maintenance release. Release versioning helps to track different iterations of the software and increments each month as part of the maintenance release.\nEach versioning scheme is purposely designed to provide a structured mechanism of releasing and tracking Itential's product versions, enabling developers to identify bugs more efficiently and maintain code integrity.\nIf you need additional support or require more information about Itential's versioning, please contact our\nProduct Support Team\n.\nNSO / Itential Tools\nItential Platform Version\nPackage\nSupported\nPlatform 6\njava\n>=1.70 <1.9.0\n2023.2\njava\n>=1.70 <1.9.0\n2023.1\njava\n>=1.70 <1.9.0\n2022.1\njava\n>=1.70 <1.9.0\n2021.2\njava\n>=1.70 <1.9.0\nNote: The ant package should be installed from your OS distribution.\nNSO Support Policy\nThe Itential Platform supports integration with tested and verified versions of NSO, which may vary for each version of Itential Platform. To this end, Itential will address any errors or flaws that affect the integration of supported NSO versions into Itential Platform. All patch releases (denoted by the third digit in the NSO version number) for supported NSO versions are covered by this policy.\n‚ö†\nItential is\nnot\nresponsible for the development or support of NSO itself.\nVersions Currently Supported\nSupported versions of NSO are defined in the Release Notes of each version of Itential Platform. In the\nDevices/Services Compatibility\nsection of the release notes, the NSO versions used for testing are listed in the\nNSO Versions\ntable. When viewing this table, note that the\nsupport policy\ndefined above applies. Though a specific patch release for each NSO version may be listed in the table,\nany\npatch release for that NSO version is supported.\n‚ö†\nWhen planning to integrate NSO into Itential Platform, keep\nlong-term support (LTS)\nversions of NSO in mind. Details regarding the support of LTS versions of NSO can be found in the\nnext section\n.\nPlanned Future Support\nThe following sections outline planned support for NSO that Itential is targeting for the future. As new versions of Itential Platform and NSO are released, testing will be required before certifying support.\nAligning With Cisco Support\nMoving forward, Itential will support any version of NSO that is supported by Cisco at that time, including LTS versions of NSO. For further information about the NSO version lifecycle, refer to the\nCisco End-of-Life and End-of-Sale Notices\n.\nBackporting Support\nWhenever a new version of NSO is released by Cisco, Itential will attempt to certify support of that NSO version for the latest existing release of IP.\nNSO Version Support Matrix\nNSO Version\n2022.1.x\n2023.1.x\n2023.2.x\nPlatform 6.0.x\n5.6.x\n‚úì\n5.7.x (LTS)\n‚úì\n‚úì\n‚úì\n‚úì\n5.8.x [1]\n‚úì\n‚úì\n6.0.x [1]\n‚úì [2]\n‚úì\n‚úì\n6.1.x (LTS) [1]\n‚úì\n‚úì\n‚úì\n‚úì\n6.2.x [1]\n‚úì [2]\n‚úì\n‚úì\n6.3.x [1]\n‚úì\n‚úì [2]\n‚úì\n6.4.x [1]\n‚úì\n‚úì [2]\n‚úì\nFootnotes\n[1] NSO version numbers that are forecasted for release in the future are subject to change.\n[2] Itential Platform support for this future version of NSO will be backported once the NSO version is released by Cisco.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Itential Dependencies"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Monthly Maintenance Release"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Release Notes"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Itential Platform"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Itential Automation Gateway"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Gateway Manager"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Host Operating System"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Itential Platform Server"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "MongoDB Server"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "RabbitMQ Server"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Redis Server"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "HashiCorp Vault"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Automation Gateway"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Ansible"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "IAG Compatibility with Itential Platform"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "IAG Versioning Practices"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "NSO / Itential Tools"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "NSO Support Policy"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Versions Currently Supported"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Planned Future Support"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Aligning With Cisco Support"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Backporting Support"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "NSO Version Support Matrix"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-product-documentation-new-faq", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/isd-support-tickets-frequently-asked-questions", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/july-2025-maintenance-release-2", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/july-2025-maintenance-release-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/july-2025-iag-maintenance-release", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-release-notes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-20232-release-notes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-20231-release-notes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-20221-release-notes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/iag-43-release-notes-1", "https://docs.itential.com/v1/docs/iag-20233-release-notes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/iag-20232-release-notes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/iag-20231-release-notes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/iag-20221-release-notes", "https://docs.itential.com/v1/docs/gateway-manager-release-notes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/rabbitmq-configuration-20231x-20221x", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/event-service-configuration-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-dependencies-consolidated#nso-support-policy", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-dependencies-consolidated#aligning-with-cisco-support"]}
{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/table-control", "title": "Table Control", "text": "Table Control\nUpdated on\nFeb 20, 2025\nPublished on Mar 21, 2024\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nTable Control is a PHUI class used to create tables that list data. It is useful where you want to list a body of entities (less than 100 entities) with multiple properties or where a data set is¬†too large to display all at once.\nTable Control offers several helpful features, including:\nActions on a single entity.\nActions on multiple entities at the same time.\nFiltering on a specific field or fields.\nSorting on a specific field or fields.\nThis guide describes how to create Table Control for an Itential Platform page.\nCreating a Table Control\nThe render of a Table Control is handled by the browser's JavaScript engine. The page can be as simple as the following.\n<div>content</div>\n<div>title-bar</div>\n\n<h3>title Device Management</h3>\n<div>workspace</div>\n<div id=\"devices-table\"></div>\nThe table will append to the\ndevices-table\ndiv\n.\nObtain the context of the table using JavaScript.\nvar context = document.getElementById('devices-table');\nTable Control will create a table in the context once you give it additional data about how you want the table to act. You can define this in an object called\ntableSeed\n.\nSuppose you want to create a table that represents a list of horses; each horse will be an entity. You represent entities internally as objects which may have a variety of properties.¬† For each horse, you want to show their name, color, and age in the table.\nCreate your\ntableSeed\nobject as shown below.\nvar tableSeed = {\n  fields: {\n    name: {\n      displayName: 'Name'\n    },\n    color: {\n      displayName: 'Color',\n    },\n    age: {\n      displayname: 'Age',\n    }\n  }\n};\nThis is the simplest valid\ntableSeed\nobject. A\ntableSeed\nmust have a fields property where you define the properties you want to display as columns. At the very least, it is recommended you specify a\ndisplayName\n, which is a human-readable description of the field. The key for each field will map to the properties of the horse objects.\nNow construct the table.\nvar horseTable = new PHUI.Table(context, tableSeed);\nYou should see a table with columns but no rows in it yet. Keep the\nhorseTable\ninstance; it will be necessary later.\nAdding Entities\nAdd the First Entity\nNow you may add some static data to your table. Create your first horse, represented as a plain JavaScript object:\nvar myFirstHorseJohn = {\n  name: 'John',\n  color: 'Green',\n  age: '42'\n};\nAdd your first horse to the table with the\npushEntity\nmethod.\nhorseTable.pushEntity(myFirstHorseJohn);\nOnce the\npushEntity\nmethod has pushed\nmyFirstHorse\nto the table, the table should immediately create the row. It knows to map name, color, and age to the corresponding fields that you defined in\ntableSeed\n.\nTable Methods\nThere are three basic methods to statically add entities to a table.\nMethod\nDescription\nmyTable.pushEntity(entity)\nAdd a single entity to the table.\nmyTable.concatEntities(entities)\nAdd an array of entities to the table.\nmyTable.setEntities(entities)\nReset the table to display a new array of entities.\nOther Table Methods\nIn addition to the previous three methods for adding entities, Table Control exposes the following methods.\nMethod\nDescription\nmyTable.getEntities()\nReturns an array of all the objects it currently knows about.\nmyTable.getMeta()\nGives an object with\nnumEntities\n, a filter object, and a sorter object (explained later).\nmyTable.remove()\nRemove the table from the DOM.\nTable Control will automatically handle sorting and filtering as you add entities. Even though the method is concatenating the horses, they will still be in the appropriate row based on the current sorter and will be hidden if filtered. You may also concatenate an array of entities at once.\nvar newHorses = [\n  {\n    name: 'Sally',\n    age: 24,\n    breed: 'Mustang',\n    gender: 'Female'\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Rebecca'\n  }\n];\nhorseTable.concatEntities(newHorses);\nNotice that the properties in the objects do not map exactly to the fields you specified earlier.\nRebecca\ndoes not have an age, and\nSally\nis a female\nMustang\nalthough the table properties do not have a\nbreed\nor a\ngender\nproperty.\nUpdating Entities\nWhen an object is added to a table, the object inherits a Table Control super class. Table Control stores objects by reference and handles view updates behind the scenes. This allows you to make modifications on the original object, and Table Control will make the appropriate table updates.\nYou can also use\ntable.getEntities()\nto get all the entity objects that you created.\nSuppose you want to remove\nJohn\n.\nmyFirstHorseJohn.removeFromTable();\nTable Control modifies the existing entity object. This way you can perform operations using the objects you originally passed it, or alternatively you can modify the entities from a call to\ngetEntities\n. They are one and the same.\nYou have removed\nmyFirstHorseJohn\nfrom the table. You still have the object; the table just forgot about it. The table added the\nremoveFromTable\nmethod to the\nmyFirstHorseJohn\nobject when it was added to the table. Every object added to a table in calls to\npushEntity\n,\nconcatEntities\n, or\nsetEntities\nadds\nremoveFromTable\n. You can also change the property of an existing entity by reassignment, and it will take effect on the entire table.\n// Note that you still have newHorses.\nvar sally = newHorses[0];\n\nsally.color = 'black';\n\n// Color will update from \"N/A\" to \"black\" in the cell in the table immediately.\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  sally.color = 'white';\n  // Color will update in the view immediately again.\n}, 5000);\nSorting and Filtering\nYou can sort and filter by setting\ncanSort\nand\ncanFilter\nto\ntrue\non specific fields in your\ntableSeed\nobject.\nCreate a new table with the following\ntableSeed\n.\nvar tableSeed = {\n  fields: {\n    name: {\n      displayName: 'Name',\n      canSort: true,\n      canFilter: true\n    },\n    color: {\n      displayName: 'Color',\n      canSort: false,\n      canFilter: false\n    },\n    age: {\n      displayname: 'Age',\n      canSort: true,\n      canFilter: false\n    }\n  }\n};\nThis will add filtering and sorting only on the specified fields.\nIf no field is marked as\ndefaultSort\n, then the first field marked as\ncanSort\nwill be used as the default sorter.\nYou can configure a specific field to be the default sorter using the following syntax.\nvar tableSeed = {\n  age: {\n    displayname: 'Age',\n    canSort: true,\n    defaultSort: -1\n    canFilter: false\n  }\n};\nThe\ndefaultSort\nproperty can be set to a value of 1 or -1.¬†If configured with a value of 1, default sorting will be in ascending order.¬†If configured with a value of -1, default sorting will be in descending order.\nDefining Row Actions\nThe\nrowActions\nfunction is performed at the entity level and allows the user to perform an action on a single entity in your table. Suppose you want the user to be able to edit horses and sell horses. You can define these row actions as shown below.\nvar sellHorse = function(horse, event) {\n  if (window.confirm('Are you sure you want to sell ' + horse.name + '?')) {\n    horse.removeFromTable();\n  }\n};\n\nvar tableSeed = {\n  fields: {\n    name: {\n      displayName: 'Name',\n      canSort: true,\n      canFilter: true\n    },\n    color: {\n      displayName: 'Color',\n      canSort: false,\n      canFilter: false\n    },\n    age: {\n      displayname: 'Age',\n      canSort: true,\n      canFilter: false\n    }\n  },\n  rowActions: {\n    edit: {\n      action: function(horse, event) {\n        // ...open modal to get newColor from user...\n        horse.color = 'newColor';\n      },\n      class: 'edit',\n      primary: false,\n      disabled: false\n    },\n    sell: {\n      action: sellHorse,\n      class: 'sell',\n      primary: true,\n      disabled: false\n    }\n  }\n};\nThe class will be a CSS class set on the button for the action, which will appear in a new cell on the right hand side of the column. Each action has an\naction\nproperty which is a function that takes the entity itself.\nThe second parameter is the DOM event from the button click, which you would normally expect from\nonclick\nactions in JavaScript. The\nprimary\nproperty specifies which action will be triggered on row click. At most, one primary action may be specified. If primary is not explicit for all fields, then the first action is primary by default.\nDefining Batch Actions\nSometimes, you may want to allow the user to perform the same action on multiple rows simultaneously. Suppose you want the user to be able to specify they have branded many horses at once. You can define this\nbatchAction\nin your\ntableSeed\nwith the following.\nvar brandHorses = function(horses) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < horses.length; i++) {\n    horse.color = 'red'; // this is reflected in the table immediately\n  }\n};\n\nvar tableSeed = {\n  batchActions: {\n    'Brand Horses': {\n      action: brandHorses,\n      class: 'brand',\n      disabled: false\n    }\n  }\n};\nTable Control will create the interface in the DOM. The user can then check many rows and select the \"Brand Horses\" button at the bottom of their viewport.\nSelecting Entities\nSometimes, you want to programmatically select certain entities. For example, suppose you want users to see all horses including those they do not own, but you want the ones they do own to be preselected, so that when the page loads some of the checkboxes are already checked. You can do that by setting the\nselected\nflag on the entity.\nvar someHorse.selected = true;\nThis will cause the horse, when pushed to the table, to come with the checkbox already checked.\nThe\nselected\nflag behaves like other entity properties that can be reset in real time. For example, suppose you want to check the first entity of a table after waiting five seconds.\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  horsesTable.getEntities()[0].selected = true;\n}, 5000);\nAfter five seconds, the first horse that was pushed will become selected instantly.\nUpdating Action Properties and Action Overriding\nRow actions or batch actions will often need to change during the run-time of your application. For example, you may want to set an action state to disabled for some entities but not others, or you may want to set the class to\nprocessing\nfor the duration of a call. Each entity object should have an\nactions\nproperty.¬† There are two ways to set the\nactions\nproperty:\nDefine the property yourself as you add entities using\npushEntities\n,\nconcatEntities\n, or\nsetEntities\n.\nLet Table Control do it for you.\nIf you choose the first option, it will allow you to specify the action state as you add entities. Moreover, you can actually specify whether an entity has an action disabled server-side.\nIf you allow Table Control to set the actions property, all¬†horses will have the property assigned\nhorses[i].actions.edit.disabled = false\n.\nRegardless of which way is used to set the\nactions\nproperty, entity objects have an\nactions\nproperty, which can be modified during run-time and the changes will take effect in the table the same as they do with updating properties.\nvar currentHorses = horseTable.getEntities();\n\n// I want to disable the edit actions on the first horse I added.\ncurrentHorses[0].actions.edit.disabled = true;\n\n// I want to update editHorse so it makes a call to the server to process\n// the \"transaction\". The call takes a while so I want to set a processing\n// icon on the button.\nvar editHorse = function(horse) {\n  horse.actions.edit.class = 'processing';\n\n  utilities.http('POST', '/horses/sell/' + horse.name)\n  .then(function() {\n    horse.actions.edit.class = 'edit';\n  }\n};\nYou can also change entire actions.\nsomeHorse.actions.edit = {\n  action: function() {\n    console.log('edit has changed');\n  },\n  class: 'new class'\n}\nAdvanced Techniques\nParcelling Data\nTable Control supports chunking data by making AJAX calls for lists that would otherwise be too large to store in the browser's primary memory. To do so, you must add the\nfetch\nfunction to your\ntableSeed\n.\nThe following is an example of filtering on a device list from an existing program.\nvar tableSeed = {\n  parcelControl: {\n\n    fetch: function(tableData, isAppend, callback) {\n      /**\n       * @param {Object} tableData\n       * @param {number} tableData.numEntities - The number of entities (table rows) currently\n       *                                         shown in the browser.\n       * @param {Object} tableData.sorter - Used when sorting is enabled. Passed through\n       *                                    to external API call as an options property.\n       * @param {number} tableData.sorter.direction - If value is 1, sorts in descending order.\n       *                                              If value is -1, sorts in ascending order.\n       * @param {string} tableData.sorter.field - The field's name used for sorting.\n       * @param {Object} tableData.filter - Used when filter is enabled on the table. Passed\n       *                                    through to external API call as an options property.\n       *                                    When a filter is applied to the table, this\n       *                                    parameter contains key-value pairs where the\n       *                                    key is a field name and the value is a string on\n       *                                    which to match.\n       * @param {boolean} isAppend - When true, tells the table that it should append data\n       *                             with the next set of incoming data.\n       *                             When false, tells the table that it should replace data\n       *                             with the next set of incoming data.\n       * @param {fetch~requestCallback} callback - The callback function that handles the\n       *                                           returned data.\n       */\n\n      /**\n       * @callback fetch~requestCallback\n       * @param {Object[]} newEntities - The response data.\n       * @param {boolean} exhausted - Set to false if more data is available.\n       *                              Set to true when all data has been returned.\n       */\n\n      var options = {\n        start: isAppend ? tableData.numEntities : 0,\n        limit: 25,\n        sort: tableData.sorter,\n        entity: 'device'\n      };\n\n      if (!isEmpty(tableData.filter)) {\n        options.filter = tableData.filter;\n      }\n\n      utilities.http('POST', '/device_management/devices/filtered', {\n        options: options\n      })\n        .then(function(res) {\n          if (!res) return callback([], true);\n          if (res.total <= res.list.length) return callback(res.list || [], true);\n          return callback(res.list || [], false);\n        })\n        .catch(handleError);\n    }\n  }\n};\nA\nfetch\ncall is made whenever Table Control decides it needs more entities. The table's parcel control uses lazy loading (also known as infinite scrolling) to display large amounts of data to the user without making calls with huge payloads or inundating browser memory. It will call\nfetch\nrepeatedly to add data to the table as the user scrolls. If the user changes the sorter or the filter, then fetch will be also called to reset the entire table data with the new sorted and filtered data. From there, the user will then be able to infinite scroll with the sort and filter applied.\nIf a table uses parcelling, then it must sort and filter by making calls to the server. If it does not use parcelling, then Table Control will always handle sorting and filtering on its own by executing the logic on the page. The client should never sort and filter data that it gets from the server if it knows that data to be a subset of a larger list.\nEssentially, there are two reasons fetch will be called.\nTo append to the list on scroll.\nTo reset entities due to a filter or sort change.\nThis is why the\nisAppend\nflag is used. It is true if fetch is called to append to the list, and false if fetch is called to reset entities due to a filter or sort change. This is important because your call needs a starting point (also known as cursor, position, etc.) from which to start the chunk. If not appending, it should start at 0 again to ensure the list starts over on a filter or sort change.\nThe callback allows the fetch call to perform asynchronous calls. This requires two arguments: an array and a boolean value.\nArgument\nDescription\nArgument 1\nA list of new entities to append (or set) to the table.\nArgument 2\nWhether or not the list is exhausted, e.g.,\nnumEntities >= totalEntities\n.\nIf Argument 2 is set to true, the infinite scroll will stop trying to call fetch repeatedly.\nStyling and Sizing\nStyling can be done with CSS class modifiers. Table Control adds a class to all\n<td\n> and\n<th>\ntags corresponding to the field name. For example, a\n<td>\nelement¬†for the Name field would have the class\nname\n. This makes it possible to set the width of a specific column.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Table Control"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Creating a Table

To configure the connection pool when connecting to MongoDB, use the\nmaxPoolSize\nsetting under\nmongoProps\nwithin the properties.json file.\nThis setting can affect performance. When the maximum number of connections is reached, no additional connections can be created (opened) in the connection pool. An incorrectly set value can also result in a performance bottleneck.\nProperty Name\nType\nDefault\nDescription\nmaxPoolSize\nInteger\n100\nA number that represents the maximum number of connections allowed within a connection pool. Valid values range from 1 to 65535.\nSample Connection Pool Configuration\n\"mongoProps\": {\n  \"db\": \"pronghorn\",\n  \"url\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\",\n  \"maxPoolSize\": 100\n}\nFor more information on connection pooling, refer to:\nMongoDB Connection Pool\nConnection Pool Performance Tuning\nConfiguring Itential Platform with MongoDB Replica Sets\nFollow these steps to\nConfigure a MongoDB Replica Set\n.\nWhen MongoDB is configured as a replica set, the properties file should be configured with the host details of each of the MongoDB members. This is done by appending each host into the\nurl\nproperty, including the name of the replica set, which in the example below is\nrs0\n.\nIn the example below, the replica set consists of three members that are configured on servers 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2 and 10.0.0.3, all on port 27017.\nThere is no need to specify the 'Primary' and 'Secondary' members. This is something each MongoDB member will decide via an 'election'.\nRefer to the MongoDB documentation for more information on\nReplica Sets and members elections\n.\nSample Configuration\nBelow is an example\nproperties.json\nconfiguration with a MongoDB replica set.\n{\n\"mongoProps\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"dbAuth\": true,\n      \"user\": \"itentialUser\",\n      \"passwd\": \"itentialPassword\"\n    },\n    \"ssl\": {\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"sslValidate\": true,\n      \"sslCA\": \"./keys/mongodb_ca.cert\",\n      \"acceptInvalidCerts\": false,\n      \"checkServerIdentity\": true\n    },\n    \"db\": \"IP\",\n    \"url\": \"mongodb://10.0.0.1:27017,10.0.0.2:27017,10.0.0.3:27017?replicaSet=rs0\"\n    }\n  }\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "MongoDB"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Upgrading MongoDB"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Installing MongoDB"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Packages to Install on RHEL"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Storage and File System Recommendations"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Read Concerns/Write Concerns"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Important Kernel Parameters to Tune"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Soft User Limits"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Disable Transparent Huge Pages"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Configure Security and Replication"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Connection Pool Size"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Sample Connection Pool Configuration"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Configuring Itential Platform with MongoDB Replica Sets"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Sample Configuration"}], "code_blocks": ["db.adminCommand(\n     { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: \"5.0\" }\n)", "db.adminCommand(\n     { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: \"5.0\" }\n)", "/dev/mapper/rhel-data /data xfs noatime,nodiratime 0 0", "net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 300", "net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 300", "vm.zone_reclaim_mode = 0", "vm.zone_reclaim_mode = 0", "net.core.somaxconn = 65535", "net.core.somaxconn = 65535", "nproc = 32000\nnofile = 64000", "nproc = 32000\nnofile = 64000", "disable-transparent-hugepages", "etc/tuned/no-thp:\n[main]\ninclude=virtual-guest\n[vm]\ntransparent_hugepages=never", "etc/tuned/no-thp:\n[main]\ninclude=virtual-guest\n[vm]\ntransparent_hugepages=never", "tuned-adm profile no-thp", "tuned-adm profile no-thp", "#Where and how to store data.\nstorage:\ndbPath: {{ mongo_data_dir }}\n\n#repairPath: {{ mongo_data_dir }}\njournal:\nenabled: true\nengine: \"wiredTiger\"", "#Where and how to store data.\nstorage:\ndbPath: {{ mongo_data_dir }}\n\n#repairPath: {{ mongo_data_dir }}\njournal:\nenabled: true\nengine: \"wiredTiger\"", "\"mongoProps\": {\n  \"db\": \"pronghorn\",\n  \"url\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\",\n  \"maxPoolSize\": 100\n}", "\"mongoProps\": {\n  \"db\": \"pronghorn\",\n  \"url\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\",\n  \"maxPoolSize\": 100\n}", "{\n\"mongoProps\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"dbAuth\": true,\n      \"user\": \"itentialUser\",\n      \"passwd\": \"itentialPassword\"\n    },\n    \"ssl\": {\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"sslValidate\": true,\n      \"sslCA\": \"./keys/mongodb_ca.cert\",\n      \"acceptInvalidCerts\": false,\n      \"checkServerIdentity\": true\n    },\n    \"db\": \"IP\",\n    \"url\": \"mongodb://10.0.0.1:27017,10.0.0.2:27017,10.0.0.3:27017?replicaSet=rs0\"\n    }\n  }", "{\n\"mongoProps\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"dbAuth\": true,\n      \"user\": \"itentialUser\",\n      \"passwd\": \"itentialPassword\"\n    },\n    \"ssl\": {\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"sslValidate\": true,\n      \"sslCA\": \"./keys/mongodb_ca.cert\",\n      \"acceptInvalidCerts\": false,\n      \"checkServerIdentity\": true\n    },\n    \"db\": \"IP\",\n    \"url\": \"mongodb://10.0.0.1:27017,10.0.0.2:27017,10.0.0.3:27017?replicaSet=rs0\"\n    }\n  }"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/rabbitmq-itential-platform-20221x-20231x", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/template-builder-dependencies-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-dependencies-consolidated", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/compatibility/#std-label-node-compatibility", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/reference/configuration-options/", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/mongodb-readconcern-write-concern-itential-platform", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/tutorial/transparent-huge-pages/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/security/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/replication/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/connection-pool-overview/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/connection-pool-performance-tuning/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/replication/"]}

Itential's Newest Software, Platform 6\nüì£\nReady to learn all about Platform 6? Everything to know is provided here, including a\nProduct Showcase\nat the end. So read on!\nNew Release Versioning\nWe are excited to announce the feature launch of our brand new\nItential Platform version, Platform 6.0.0\n! Get ready to experience next level automation and orchestration for network infrastructure that makes it easier to work within Itential Platform.\nÔÅö\nItential has changed the version number scheme for the Itential Platform from date-based versioning to semantic versioning. All future releases of Itential Platform will follow the scheme\nMAJOR.MINOR.MTCE\n.\nMAJOR\n: A change of the major number indicates incompatible API changes.\nMINOR\n: A change of the minor number indicates a release with added functionality and a backwards compatible API.\nMTCE\n: A change of MTCE number indicates a maintenance release that includes bug fixes and minor improvements.\nThis change aligns with Itential's other software products, including IAG 4 and IAG 5, and is in alignment with industry norms.\nFor more information on semantic versioning, please visit\nSemantic Versioning 2.0.0\nThe key objectives behind the launch of\nPlatform 6\nfocus on Security, Support, and Simplification for Itential customers.\nSecurity\n: Itential has reworked the platform‚Äôs backend to align with today‚Äôs cutting-edge technology, resulting in improved Platform performance and enhanced security.\nSupport\n: Customers can now more easily self-service their use cases with a robust\nIntegrations\nengine that offers expanded authorization and authentication support while providing detailed responses to assist in troubleshooting broken integrations.\nLCM\nhas also been enhanced to offer an audit trail, showing customers how information has changed over time within an instance.\nSimplification\n: Enhancements to\nProjects\nempower users by alerting users to missing, corrupted, or altered references within their destination environments. Additionally, Projects has been simplified with a robust reference management system supporting the intelligent remapping of child jobs, transformations, forms, and other assets when moving, copying, or renaming projects and their components. Platform Installation and Startup has also been simplified with the platform now supporting the RPM Package Management System and simplified configuration. The RPM package manager brings management of Itential dependencies (Python and Node) to the installation process (excludes Redis and Mongo), and removes the requirement for pre-startup configuration scripts. Platform configuration has been expanded to support configuration via Environmental Variables, on-disk data configuration file, or database.\nFeatured Improvements\nThe following provides an overview of the features offered to customers as part of Itential Platform 6:\nIntegrations\nThe next generation of Integrations in Platform 6 expands authentication support, enabling customers to transition from Adapters to Integrations with fewer demands on system resources.\nExpanded support for global headers and parameters, with the ability to define query parameters, headers, and cookies across the Integrations.\nAbility to directly connect with external systems with additional OpenAPI 3.1 authentication and authorization, including support for Mutual TLS, OAuth2.0 Grant Flows, and OpenID Connect.\nDynamic API Keys to improve the security of asset retrieval.\nImproved UI/UX with more detailed information provided within Integration responses to support troubleshooting.\nSimplified integration responses to ensure the information that customers need is easier to locate, and the return payload size is kept to a minimum.\nLifecycle Manager\nLifecycle Manager (LCM) in Platform 6 enables customers to efficiently automate and manage large numbers of LCM instances.\nCustomers can fully automate the creation, management, and deletion of LCM instances, reducing manual work and complexity.\nWith Instance Groups, customers can perform actions against multiple instances at the same time, removing the limitation of addressing each instance separately.\nCustomers now have the ability to track changing properties within instances and the flow of instance data across time.\nBy integrating LCM with Operations Manager, customers can now set triggers for Lifecycle Resource Models and actions.\nProjects\nPlatform 6 brings intuitive and intelligent reference management when importing assets into Projects, with better understanding to what a Project is referencing, especially between environments.\nWith automatic discovery and remapping of references, manual rework has been eliminated. Customers can automatically discover and import all references from an imported asset, ensuring they have transparency into the function of a project.\nUpon import to a new environment, all external project references are validated within the new system. This ensures reference consistency across environments and prevents unexpected behavior during project promotion.\nCore Enhancements\nItential has made major improvements to the Platform Core, with further enhancements to Platform security, reliability and performance.\nImplemented HashiCorp AppRole methods to support authentication between Itential Platform and HashiCorp Vault.\nRemoved Angular to enhance Itential Platform stability, performance, and security.\nImplemented user defined encryption keys and key rotation to enhance user security.\nImplemented new Device Counts within Admin Essentials to easily see how many devices are connected to Itential Platform.\nAdded new\nServer.apiread\nor\nServer.admin\nuser roles to access the advanced Configuration view (service config editor) inside Admin Essentials.\nPlatform Infrastructure\nTo deliver a higher quality software, Itential has improved how we build, test, and distribute Itential Platform.\nExpanded suite of automated testing.\nIncreased automation to reduce the manual process required to build Itential Platform while ensuring compatibility against supported operating systems (AL23, Rocky 8/9, RHEL 8/9).\nImproved artifact distribution with customer access to RPM files and Container Images.\nImproved customer access control to artifact distribution with token-based authentication.\nEnhanced auditing and tracking in artifact distribution that provides Itential visibility into artifact usage and downloads.\nStartup & Configuration\nTo simplify the experience of installing, configuring and completing a first-time-run of Itential Platform, the number of steps to configure and startup have been reduced. Customers can essentially configure once and deploy to multiple locations, and update more frequently with less downtime.\nConsolidated the information required for Itential Platform startup into a single location properties file.\nEnabled the ability to configure Itential Platform entirely through environmental variables.\nImplemented default values.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-upgrade", "title": "Platform Upgrade", "text": "Platform Upgrade\nUpdated on\nAug 2, 2025\nPublished on Feb 27, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nThis guide will provide users instructions on how to upgrade their Itential Platform installation from 22.1, 23.1, or 23.2 to Platform 6, Itential's latest platform product.\nÔÅö\nDue to changes in the Platform 6 directory structures, Itential strongly recommends against an in-place upgrade, and instead recommends a greenfield installation and migration of applications, adapters, and database. The instructions below will detail that process.\nPrerequisites\nBefore taking any action, please:\nReview this document in full to understand the steps involved for your upgrade to successfully take place, and be sure to review all Product Notices related to Platform 6.\nThis will ensure you are well informed of any\nDeprecations\nassociated with upgrading to the target version.\nTo avoid service disruption, be sure to pay particular attention to the detail within the\nBreaking Changes\n.\nIf you need help establishing an upgrade plan for your Itential software, please contact your Itential Account Manager.\nInstallation of Platform 6\nInstallation of Platform 6 may be accomplished following the instructions here:\nInstallation Guide\nMigration of Encrypted Secrets\nWith the change to Platform 6, Itential has enabled users to define an encryption key for use within the platform.\nÔÅö\nAn encryption key is required for operation of Itential Platform 6\nExisting data sets from prior Platform releases will likely contain encrypted secret values. These values must be migrated to use the encryption key provided by the user in Platform configuration prior to platform start.\nItential provides a one-time migration utility as part of the Platform installation to assist in this process.\nThis utility will connect to an existing Itential Platform database, decrypt existing secrets, re-encrypt them with a user-specified key, and then write them back to the database. Additionally, if a\nproperties.json\nfile is used to configure the database connection, and that\nproperties.json\nfile contains\n$ENC\nencrypted values, the values in that file will be migrated as well.\n‚ö†\nA backup of the MongoDB Database is required prior to running the Key Migration Utility. The Key Migration Utility is designed to connect and write to the database it is directed to operate on.\n‚ö†\nIf a\nproperties.json\nfile is used and contains\n$ENC\nencrypted secrets, create a backup of the file before running the Key Migration Utility. Encrypted values will be rotated in-place in the original file.\n‚ö†\nThe Key Migration Utility cannot be run multiple times on a single database. All collections within the database must be migrated when running the tool. Any collections not migrated cannot be migrated at a later time. If a collection is not migrated, or the migration script is interrupted, users must restore the database from backup and run the Key Migration Utility again.\nTo run the migration utility, use the command\nnpm run key:migrate\nfrom inside\n/opt/itential/platform/server\n. This utility requires a database connection, and is compatible with the same environment variables, properties configuration file, and legacy\nproperties.json\nfile that the platform server supports.\nThe migration utility requires that either the\n--config-file\nparameter or\n--properties-json\nparameter to be given, and requires that the\n--encryption-key\nparameter be provided.\nÔÅö\nAll arguments passed to the script must be separated from the script name by an ‚Äúend-of-options delimiter‚Äù:\n--\n. This is required by\nnpm\n.\nValid application of an argument for\n--encryption-key\n:\nnpm run key:migrate -- --encryption-key \"$KEY\"\nInvalid application of an argument for\n--encryption-key\n(missing end-of-options delimiter):\nnpm run key:migrate --encryption-key \"$KEY\"\nTo configure the script's database connection with a properties configuration file, use the\n--config-file\nparameter.\nnpm run key:migrate -- --config-file /etc/itential/platform.properties\nTo use a legacy\nproperties.json\nfile to configure the script, use the\n--properties-json\nparameter. Note that this parameter is mutually exclusive with the\n--config-file\nparameter. They cannot both be given in the same command.\nnpm run key:migrate -- --properties-json ./properties.json\nTo use environment variables to amend configuration in the event that a property is not present in your configuration file, ensure they are set before running the command.\nITENTIAL_MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017 \\\nITENTIAL_MONGO_DB_NAME=itential \\\n  npm run key:migrate -- --config-file /etc/itential/platform.properties\nThe key migration utility requires an explicitly defined key. Placing your encryption key in configuration is not supported. Use the\n--encryption-key\nparameter to specify your key.\nnpm run key:migrate -- --encryption-key \"$KEY\"\nThe key migration utility will migrate encrypted secrets in the following collections by default:\nservice_configs\noauth_clients\naccounts\niap_profiles\nIf your organization uses custom collections, and those collections are known to contain values encrypted with Itential Platform‚Äôs legacy\n$ENC\nencryption scheme, the key migration utility supports additional collections with the\n--extra-collections\nparameter. Specify this parameter once for each collection name you wish to migrate alongside Itential‚Äôs standard set of collections.\nA full example command is provided below:\nnpm run key:migrate -- \\\n  --encryption-key \"$KEY\" \\\n  --properties-json ./properties.json \\\n  --extra-collections custom-collection-1 \\\n  --extra-collections custom-collection-2\nAs it runs, the migration utility will report on its progress and any encrypted values it finds. After the script completes, you are free to connect Itential Platform 6 to your existing database.\nExample output transcript:\n> @itential/iap@6.0.0 key:migrate\n> node utils/keyMigrate.js --encryption-key 0000111122223333444455556666777788889999aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff --properties-json ./properties.json --extra-collections custom-collection-1 --extra-collections custom-collection-2\n\nDecrypting mongo properties\nCollection service_configs migrated document 1 with _id 67c07c608998f13133c9ba97 pointer /properties/properties/database/url\nCollection service_configs migrated document 1 with _id 67c07c608998f13133c9ba97 pointer /properties/properties/database/credentials/passwd\nCollection service_configs migrated document 1 with _id 67c07c608998f13133c9ba97 pointer /properties/properties/database/credentials/user\nCollection service_configs: Successfully replaced 1 of 1 documents\nCouldn't find collection oauth_clients in available collections.

The default location of custom applications and adapters is:\n/opt/itential/platform/services\nÔÅö\nUsers may define a directory for Custom Apps and Adapters, if desired. Either the\nservice_directory\nproperty in the\nplatform.properties\nfile, the\nITENTIAL_SERVICE_DIRECTORY\nenvironment variable, or the\nserviceDirectory\nfield in a profile document can specify a user-defined directory for adapter installation.\nAfter defining the new location for custom applications and adapters, copy any custom applications and adapters from the Itential Platform 22.1, 23.1, or 23.2 installation. Itential's Open Source adapter offering is installed to the following path:\n/opt/itential/current/node_modules/@itentialopensource\nApplications and adapters produced by your organization will likely have a different path. If you have organization-managed applications or adapters, consult with your system administrator to determine their location.\nCopy all custom apps and adapters into the new custom service directory associated with Platform 6. This is located at the following path by default:\n/opt/itential/platform/services\nMigration of Properties\nBeginning with Platform 6, Itential Platform configuration within a\nproperties.json\nfile has been deprecated.\nThe platform is now fully configurable via:\nOn-disk\nplatform.properties\nfile\nEnvironment variables\nPlatform 6 continues to support database profiles and the legacy\nproperties.json\nfile, but recommends that the user transitions to environment variables or the\nplatform.properties\nfile.\nTransition to Platform Properties\nA template\nplatform.properties\nfile is supplied within the following directory:\n/opt/itential/platform/server/utils/template.properties\nUsers may continue to utilize a\nproperties.json\nfile by placing the file within the following directory:\n/opt/itential/platform/server\nRelated Reading\nPlatform 6\nConfiguration Enhancements\nInstallation\nAdapters & Custom Apps\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Platform Upgrade"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Prerequisites"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Installation of Platform 6"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Migration of Encrypted Secrets"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Migration of Apps and Adapters"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Migration of Properties"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Transition to Platform Properties"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Related Reading"}], "code_blocks": ["/opt/itential/platform/server", "npm run key:migrate -- --encryption-key \"$KEY\"", "npm run key:migrate -- --encryption-key \"$KEY\"", "npm run key:migrate --encryption-key \"$KEY\"", "npm run key:migrate --encryption-key \"$KEY\"", "npm run key:migrate -- --config-file /etc/itential/platform.properties", "npm run key:migrate -- --config-file /etc/itential/platform.properties", "npm run key:migrate -- --properties-json ./properties.json", "npm run key:migrate -- --properties-json ./properties.json", "ITENTIAL_MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017 \\\nITENTIAL_MONGO_DB_NAME=itential \\\n  npm run key:migrate -- --config-file /etc/itential/platform.properties", "ITENTIAL_MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017 \\\nITENTIAL_MONGO_DB_NAME=itential \\\n  npm run key:migrate -- --config-file /etc/itential/platform.properties", "npm run key:migrate -- --encryption-key \"$KEY\"", "npm run key:migrate -- --encryption-key \"$KEY\"", "npm run key:migrate -- \\\n  --encryption-key \"$KEY\" \\\n  --properties-json ./properties.json \\\n  --extra-collections custom-collection-1 \\\n  --extra-collections custom-collection-2", "npm run key:migrate -- \\\n  --encryption-key \"$KEY\" \\\n  --properties-json ./properties.json \\\n  --extra-collections custom-collection-1 \\\n  --extra-collections custom-collection-2", "> @itential/iap@6.0.0 key:migrate\n> node utils/keyMigrate.js --encryption-key 0000111122223333444455556666777788889999aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff --properties-json ./properties.json --extra-collections custom-collection-1 --extra-collections custom-collection-2\n\nDecrypting mongo properties\nCollection service_configs migrated document 1 with _id 67c07c608998f13133c9ba97 pointer /properties/properties/database/url\nCollection service_configs migrated document 1 with _id 67c07c608998f13133c9ba97 pointe", "> @itential/iap@6.0.0 key:migrate\n> node utils/keyMigrate.js --encryption-key 0000111122223333444455556666777788889999aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff --properties-json ./properties.json --extra-collections custom-collection-1 --extra-collections custom-collection-2\n\nDecrypting mongo properties\nCollection service_configs migrated document 1 with _id 67c07c608998f13133c9ba97 pointer /properties/properties/database/url\nCollection service_configs migrated document 1 with _id 67c07c608998f13133c9ba97 pointe", "/opt/itential/platform/services", "/opt/itential/platform/services", "ITENTIAL_SERVICE_DIRECTORY", "/opt/itential/current/node_modules/@itentialopensource", "/opt/itential/current/node_modules/@itentialopensource", "/opt/itential/platform/services", "/opt/itential/platform/services", "/opt/itential/platform/server/utils/template.properties", "/opt/itential/platform/server/utils/template.properties", "/opt/itential/platform/server", "/opt/itential/platform/server"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-installation", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-adapters-custom-apps", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-deprecations", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-breaking-changes", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-install", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-configuration-enhancements", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-install", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-adapters-custom-apps"]}

Fixed issues with multi-select dropdowns that use a large dataset.\nENG-7205\nOpenAPI Integration Models can be imported, but when creating an instance or starting the server with a created instance, an error occurred within Admin Essentials. Updated the\nswagger-client\nto ensure support of OpenAPI 3.1 integrations.\nENG-7848\nRetrieving devices with the\ngetDevicesFiltered\nAPI call did not return results as expected via Config Manager and Automation Gateway tasks. Fixed\nostypes\nfiltering to correctly retrieve and retrurn devices.\nENG-7883\nWhen deleting a switch case in the JST Designer canvas, the switch method card and transitions are not updated properly. Deleting a switch case now works as expected.\nENG-7925\nPreviously, users with view access only to a project where able to remove assets by moving them to a project where users had editor access. A fix has been pushed to not allow users with view access to move these assets.\nENG-8045\nWhen adding a function in JST Designer, the name may unexpectedly add a \"(1)\". Updated logic to check for\nid\nand name collisons to fix a case where adding a function to a JST would unnecessarily rename the function.\nENG-8354\nWhen Itential Platform is running with no active profile, an error message displays when the user tries to create, update, or delete a repository configuration in Admin Essentials. Updated the error message to include more detail about the cause for the error.\nENG-8368\nResolved an issue when trying to find assets related to a Project. Implemented a tree view in the References Panel that allows users to search for references ad-hoc.\nENG-9018\nIn a JSON Form with a table that has a custom key, adding a form element to the table and then changing the custom key no longer removes the added element.\nENG-9031\nAPI errors as a result of cloning a Command Template and Analytic Template no longer crash the UI. Also updated the JSON schema for Command Templates and Analytic Templates to allow for the\ncreatedBy\nand\nlastUpdatedBy\nfields to be\nnull\n.\nENG-9222\nRemoved request queue for integration tasks to prevent CPU increase when worker threads are unavailable. Added logs to improve debugging for integration tasks.\nENG-9268\nWhen collapsing a schema in JST Designer, any nested assignments disappear which allows users to create invalid duplicate assignments. Fixed the schema collapse issue to ensure assignments persist and prevent invalid assignments.\nENG-9305\nWhen attempting to duplicate or import a project in Automation Studio, workflows disappear from the duplicated or imported project. Updated the schema logic to resolve issue. Workflows, templates, transformations and JSON forms should now appear correctly when duplicating or importing a project.\nENG-9419\nIn some scenarios, the Platform would not correctly handle changes in Redis Sentinel cluster topology.

This guide introduces Policy Engine along with related information that takes you through Policy Engine installation and configuration.\nIP Address and Network Validation and Normalization\nItential Policy Engine provides functions for validating strings passed in as IP addresses or Network addresses. In addition to reporting validity, it also returns the IP version of the address and a canonical form that represents the same endpoint address or network. For IPv4 networks, CIDR notation is canonical. Whereas for IPv6 the shortest representation is canonical, eliminating zeroes where possible.\nBest effort parsing means that all common formats for IPv4 and IPv6 endpoint addresses and network notations are recognized, and even uncommon or noisy ones are often accepted.\nRegistered Port Information\nItential Policy Engine provides lookups for registered ports by port number or registered name, with optional restriction to a single Layer 4 protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.). This can be used to translate between port numbers and IANA names for various use cases.\nMAC Address Validation and Information\nItential Policy Engine provides functions for validating MAC addresses and deriving various information from them, such as version (48 vs 64), the converted EUI64 value of an EUI48 address, the issuing organization, and other useful information.\nTraffic Policy Analysis\nPolicy Analysis is the namesake use case for Policy Engine, and it provides functions for analyzing a device's traffic policy for certain use cases, such as identifying redundancies in a policy and checking proposed rules against a policy for redundancy and conflict.\nInstallation\nPolicy Engine is a stateless, compute only Web Service, and is hosted on a server as described below. It is distributed as a python pip package.\nPrerequisites\nPython 3.6.3 or better and pip (for pip installation)\nAvailable listener port (8080 by default, configurable)\nHA deployments should use a load balancer, and likewise SSL or Authentication should be terminated by a load balancer or reverse proxy. Such configurations are beyond the scope of this procedure, but should be fairly straightforward as the service is synchronous, stateless, and side-effect free.\nInstall Policy Engine via pip on CentOS 7\nInstall RH SCL, Python 3.6, and pip\nsudo yum update\nsudo yum install centos-release-scl\nsudo yum install rh-python36\nInstall in SCL Environment\nFrom a file:\nsudo scl enable rh-python36 \"pip install --upgrade service-policy-1.10.8+2022.1.0.tar.gz\"\nClick here for 2022.1\nsudo scl enable rh-python36 \"pip install --upgrade service-policy-<version>.tar.gz\"\nOr from the Itential repository:\nsudo scl enable rh-python36 \"pip install service-policy --upgrade --extra-index-url=<itential pip repo url>\"\nStart the service manually to test\nPORT=4567 scl enable rh-python36 service-policy\nSet up a systemd service\nIn\n/etc/systemd/system/policyengine.service\n:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Itential Policy Engine\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nRestart=always\nRestartSec=1\nUser=policyengine\nEnvironment=\"PORT=4567\"\nExecStart=/bin/scl enable rh-python36 service-policy\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nsudo systemctl start policyengine\nsudo systemctl enable policyengine\nInstall Policy Engine via pip on Ubuntu 18.04\nInstall pip\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install python3-pip\nInstall Policy Engine\nFrom a file:\nsudo pip3 install --upgrade service-policy-1.10.8+2022.1.0.tar.gz\nClick here for 2022.1\nsudo pip3 install --upgrade service-policy-<version>.tar.gz\nOr from the Itential repository:\nsudo pip3 install service-policy --upgrade --extra-index-url=<itential pip repo url>\nStart the service manually to test\nPORT=4567 service-policy\nSet up a systemd service\nIn\n/etc/systemd/system/policyengine.service\n:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Itential Policy Engine\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nRestart=always\nRestartSec=1\nUser=policyengine\nEnvironment=\"PORT=4567\"\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/service-policy\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nsudo systemctl start policyengine\nsudo systemctl enable policyengine\nPost installation\nThe service is a simple compute-only web service, and does not need access to read/write anything.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-configuration-enhancements", "title": "Configuration Enhancements", "text": "Configuration Enhancements\nUpdated on\nJul 10, 2025\nPublished on Feb 27, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nThe end-to-end experience of installing, configuring and completing a first-time run of Itential Platform has been simplified, and you can now configure Platform 6, Itential's latest software release, through environment variables with the ability to deploy as a container. There are several feature benefits to deploying installation of the Platform in this way, namely:\nConsolidated Startup Configuration\n: All startup configuration is now in a single location.\nUser-Defined Environmental Variables\n: Platform 6 can be configured entirely through environmental variables, including an encryption key.\nIntelligent Default Values\n: Itential Platform will automatically generate and pre-fill default common values if a customer does not fully configure their system.\nHierarchical Configuration:\nConfiguration will follow a hierarchy that allows customers to configure once and deploy to several locations.\nDefault User\n: Enable customers to login and configure Itential Platform without first setting up Local AAA (default user).\nAnother improvement to the experience of installing and configuring Itential Platform is the efficiency gain of time and resources during upgrades. Additionally, having this new install allows users to define their own Encryption Key, and provide that key within environmental variables, or via the on-disk properties document. Lastly, these start up features are inherent to Platform 6 and require no installation.\nConfiguration\nIn previous Itential Platform releases, configuration was delegated between a\nproperties.json\nfile and a\nprofile\nconfigured within MongoDB. Starting with the Platform 6 release, Itential Platform is now primarily configured through Environment Variables or a functionally equivalent\nplatform.properties\nconfiguration file. This functionality replaces the legacy\nproperties.json\nfile. As such,configuration via\nproperties.json\nis fully deprecated in Platform 6.\nStarting with Platform 6, the\nbin\ninstaller will no longer copy over the previous\nproperties.json\nfile. To migrate a\nproperties.json\nfile into a new\nplatform.properties\nfile, run this command:\nnpm run migrate:properties -- --json-file=<path> --out-file=<path>\nThe file generated by this script includes commented out defaults and descriptions for all excluded properties.\nItential Platform can be supplied a\nplatform.properties\nfile (or a\nproperties.json\n) with the\n--config-file=<path>\nlaunch option. If no\n--config-file\nargument is given, Itential Platform will first look in\n/etc/itential/platform.properties\n, then the Platform installation directory for a\nproperties.json\n. If neither file exists, defaults will be used for all configurations not defined by Environment Variables.\nProfiles are also no longer required for configuration. It is best practice in Platform 6 to use Profiles only for configurations that may change while the server is running, such as\nprebuiltProps\n.\nAdditionally, if no configuration for a property exists, Platform 6 will now supply a sensible default value. When conflicting configuration properties are provided, they are resolved in the following priority order:\nEnvironment Variable\nConfiguration File\nProfile\nDefault Value\nThis hierarchy allows users to make a reusable Configuration File and override any necessary properties with Environment Variables for deployment.\nTo view the current configuration in Platform 6, navigate to the\nItential Platform ‚Üí Admin Essentials ‚Üí Configuration page\n. From this page view, all configuration properties, their values and their origins are shown (Figure 1).\nProperty File Formats\nTo illustrate the differences in property file formats between Itential Platform release versions, the following samples will demonstrate how property names are displayed. For a complete table of properties in Platform 6 see the\nPlatform Properties and Environment Variables reference\n.\nLegacy Platform\nLegacy\nproperties.json\nfile (Itential Platform 2022.1, 2023.1 and 20232.2)\nThis is also the format used by\nProfiles\n.\n{\n  \"serviceDirectory\": \"dev/services\",\n  \"mongoProps\": {\n    \"db\": \"platform6\"\n  },\n  \"loggerProps\": {\n    \"log_directory\": \"dev\",\n    \"webserver\": {\n      \"log_directory\": \"dev\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"authenticationProps\": {\n    \"admins\": [\n      {\n        \"provenance\":\"Local AAA\",\n        \"group\":\"pronghorn_admin\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"encryptionKey\": \"74b589bce5a0aaae1d45f13479208f34f5eb0458bde7fb81a2f26ee8d61fae37\"\n}\nPlatform 6\nHere is the equivalent\nplatform.properties\nConfiguration file (Itential Platform 6).\n# My Comment\nservice_directory = dev/services\nmongo_db_name = platform6\nlog_directory = dev\nwebserver_log_directory = dev\nauth_admin_groups = [{\"provenance\":\"Local AAA\",\"group\":\"pronghorn_admin\"}]\nencryption_key = 74b589bce5a0aaae1d45f13479208f34f5eb0458bde7fb81a2f26ee8d61fae37\nEnv Variables Platform 6\nHere is an equivalent declaration of Environment Variables (Itential Platform 6).\nexport ITENTIAL_SERVICE_DIRECTORY=\"dev/services\"\nexport IAP_MONGO_DB_NAME=platform6\nexport IAP_LOG_DIRECTORY=dev\nexport IAP_WEBSERVER_LOG_DIRECTORY=dev\nexport IAP_AUTH_ADMIN_GROUPS='[{\"provenance\":\"Local AAA\",\"group\":\"pronghorn_admin\"}]'\nexport IAP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=74b589bce5a0aaae1d45f13479208f34f5eb0458bde7fb81a2f26ee8d61fae37\nDefault User\nPreviously, Itential Platform required users to install an AAA adapter before being able to log in and use the platform, which meant the install had to be done without the GUI. Platform 6 now enables a default user account to log in and configure any necessary AAA adapters through Admin Essentials. The default user can be configured with the following variables.\nplatform.properties\nEnvironment Variable\nType\ndefault_user_enabled\nITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_ENABLED\nBoolean\ndefault_user_username\nITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_USERNAME\nString\ndefault_user_password\nITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD\nString\nThe primary purpose of the default user is only to set up the first\nadmin\naccount. Once any AAA/SSO adapter is enabled, the default user will be disabled from logging in again, and the Platform should be restarted.\nStatus Page\nPrior to Platform 6, the Profiles page in Admin Essentials contained ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdapters‚Äù, ‚ÄúConfigure‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIndexing‚Äù tabs. Now that Itential Platform can now run without a Profile, the ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdapters‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIndexing‚Äù tabs were moved for accessibility.\nThe Profiles page in Admin Essentials now only contains the contents of the ‚ÄúConfigure‚Äù tab. As implied by the location, any configuration done inside of a Profile will only affect that Profile; there is no way to modify a Config File or Environment Variables in Admin Essentials.\nThe contents of the three moved tabs  (‚ÄúApplications‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdapters‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIndexing‚Äù) can be found on the new\nStatus\npage. These moved tabs still provide the same information and controls as before;\nApplications\ngives status information of all configured Platform services,\nAdapters\ngives information about configured Adapters, and\nIndexing\ngives the status of the MongoDB indexing.\nLimitations\nSome known limitations associated with the Platform 6 configuration include:\nProfiles are still only accessible after connecting to MongoDB. Any configuration related to MongoDB (including encryption) cannot be defined within a Profile.\nAny\nConfiguration\nsetting that captures the Platform state must only exist in a Profile document. As of Platform 6, the only stateful property is\nprebuiltProps\n.\nThe\nswitchActiveProfile\nAPI has been deprecated. Switching profiles is only possible when Itential Platform has been configured with a deprecated\nproperties.json\nfile.\nEnvironment Variables and Config Files are only read when Itential Platform starts. You must restart the platform to see changes in configuration.\nItential Platform will never automatically modify the contents of your\nplatform.properties\nfile or your Environment Variables. Any changes to your\nplatform.properties\nfile must be done outside of the Platform.\nThe Default User is only able to log in before any AAA/SSO Adapter is configured. Once a qualifying Adapter is running, Itential Platform will not accept new logins by the default user, though active sessions with this user may continue to function.\nOnly one configuration file may be supplied to the Platform. If there is both a file at\n/etc/itential/platform.properties\n, a legacy\nproperties.json\nin the installation directory, and no\n--config-file\noption is supplied, only the\nplatform.properties\nfile will be used, as it is the first location checked.\nShould you encounter any issues during configuration or need extra support, please reach out to the Itential Service Desk using the\nCustomer Portal\nlink.\nRelated Reading\nPlatform 6\nInstallation\nUpgrading\nAdapters & Custom Apps\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Configuration Enhancements"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Configuration"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Property File Formats"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Legacy Platform"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Platform 6"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Env Variables Platform 6"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Default User"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Status Page"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Limitations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Related Reading"}], "code_blocks": ["npm run migrate:properties -- --json-file=<path> --out-file=<path>", "npm run migrate:properties -- --json-file=<path> --out-file=<path>", "/etc/itential/platform.properties", "{\n  \"serviceDirectory\": \"dev/services\",\n  \"mongoProps\": {\n    \"db\": \"platform6\"\n  },\n  \"loggerProps\": {\n    \"log_directory\": \"dev\",\n    \"webserver\": {\n      \"log_directory\": \"dev\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"authenticationProps\": {\n    \"admins\": [\n      {\n        \"provenance\":\"Local AAA\",\n        \"group\":\"pronghorn_admin\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"encryptionKey\": \"74b589bce5a0aaae1d45f13479208f34f5eb0458bde7fb81a2f26ee8d61fae37\"\n}", "{\n  \"serviceDirectory\": \"dev/services\",\n  \"mongoProps\": {\n    \"db\": \"platform6\"\n  },\n  \"loggerProps\": {\n    \"log_directory\": \"dev\",\n    \"webserver\": {\n      \"log_directory\": \"dev\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"authenticationProps\": {\n    \"admins\": [\n      {\n        \"provenance\":\"Local AAA\",\n        \"group\":\"pronghorn_admin\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"encryptionKey\": \"74b589bce5a0aaae1d45f13479208f34f5eb0458bde7fb81a2f26ee8d61fae37\"\n}", "# My Comment\nservice_directory = dev/services\nmongo_db_name = platform6\nlog_directory = dev\nwebserver_log_directory = dev\nauth_admin_groups = [{\"provenance\":\"Local AAA\",\"group\":\"pronghorn_admin\"}]\nencryption_key = 74b589bce5a0aaae1d45f13479208f34f5eb0458bde7fb81a2f26ee8d61fae37", "# My Comment\nservice_directory = dev/services\nmongo_db_name = platform6\nlog_directory = dev\nwebserver_log_directory = dev\nauth_admin_groups = [{\"provenance\":\"Local AAA\",\"group\":\"pronghorn_admin\"}]\nencryption_key = 74b589bce5a0aaae1d45f13479208f34f5eb0458bde7fb81a2f26ee8d61fae37", "export ITENTIAL_SERVICE_DIRECTORY=\"dev/services\"\nexport IAP_MONGO_DB_NAME=platform6\nexport IAP_LOG_DIRECTORY=dev\nexport IAP_WEBSERVER_LOG_DIRECTORY=dev\nexport IAP_AUTH_ADMIN_GROUPS='[{\"provenance\":\"Local AAA\",\"group\":\"pronghorn_admin\"}]'\nexport IAP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=74b589bce5a0aaae1d45f13479208f34f5eb0458bde7fb81a2f26ee8d61fae37", "export ITENTIAL_SERVICE_DIRECTORY=\"dev/services\"\nexport IAP_MONGO_DB_NAME=platform6\nexport IAP_LOG_DIRECTORY=dev\nexport IAP_WEBSERVER_LOG_DIRECTORY=dev\nexport IAP_AUTH_ADMIN_GROUPS='[{\"provenance\":\"Local AAA\",\"group\":\"pronghorn_admin\"}]'\nexport IAP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=74b589bce5a0aaae1d45f13479208f34f5eb0458bde7fb81a2f26ee8d61fae37", "ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_ENABLED", "default_user_username", "ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_USERNAME", "default_user_password", "ITENTIAL_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD", "/etc/itential/platform.properties"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/installing-itential-platform-6", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-installation", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-properties-environment-variables", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-installation", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-upgrade", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-adapters-custom-apps"]}

Directories can include the\n*\nwildcard. Only required when connecting to NSO versions earlier than 4.5.2.\nmax_reconnect_attempts\nNumber\nThe maximum number of times Itential Platform will try to connect to NSO before stopping. If\nmax_reconnect_attempts\nand\ntotal_reconnect_window\nare both configured, whichever condition is met first will set the effective limit. If this is set to\n0\n, Itential Platform will continue to connect to NSO indefinitely using a back-off algorithm.\ntotal_reconnect_window\nNumber\nA maximum reconnect window (number of minutes) can also be configured. If\nmax_reconnect_attempts\nand\ntotal_reconnect_window\nare both configured, whichever condition is met first will set the effective limit. If this is set to\n0\n, no time window will be enforced.\nmin_reconnect_interval\nNumber\nThe number of seconds to wait once an NSO down event is detected before the first re-connection attempt. This value will be doubled for each subsequent attempt until the\nmax_reconnect_interval\nis reached.\nmax_reconnect_interval\nNumber\nWhen NSO becomes unavailable, Itential Platform will start its reconnect timer at\nmin_reconnect_interval\n. If the first reconnect attempt fails, the reconnect timer will be doubled each time a connection attempt fails. The process of attempting a connection and doubling the reconnect timer will continue until the reconnect timer reaches (or exceeds) the\nmax_reconnect_interval\n. All future re-connect attempts will occur at this frequency.\nnetconfSubscriptions\nArray of Strings\nList of NETCONF streams in NSO to listen for NETCONF events.\nentity_cache_TTL\nNumber\nThe number of hours that device metadata entries are stored in the entity cache. The default value is\n24\n. If set to\n0\n, device information caching is disabled.\nmax_cache_entries\nNumber\nThe maximum number of device metadata entries to be stored in the entity cache. The default value is\n5000\n.\nSample Configuration\nA sample NSO adapter configuration is provided for reference. Be sure to configure the following properties:\nhttp.host\nhttp.port\nssl.enabled\nssl.caFile\nssl.ciphers\nnetconf.host\nnetconf.port\ncredentials.user\ncredentials.passwd\nThe default configuration is to use a\nmachineLogin\nfor all transactions. To enable individual user authorization to be handled by NSO, NSO must be configured with an external authentication script capable of returning external group memberships for a given user id.

Both external-authentication and either location-authentication or PAM should be enabled. Itential Platform will initially make a connection using a global service account with admin privileges.\nWhen performing transactions that can bind a particular request to a human user account, Itential Platform will start making calls on behalf of a specific user, (e.g.,\nbobjones\ninstead of\nadmin\n.\nvi /etc/ncs/ncs.conf\n  \n...\n<aaa>\n    <ssh-server-key-dir>${NCS_CONFIG_DIR}/ssh</ssh-server-key-dir>\n\n    <!-- Depending on OS - and also depending on user requirements -->\n    <!-- the pam service value value must be tuned. -->\n\n    <pam>\n        <enabled>false</enabled>\n        <service>system-auth</service>\n    </pam>\n    <external-authentication>\n        <enabled>true</enabled>\n        <executable>/var/opt/ncs/packages/itential-tools/external_auth/ph-auth.py</executable>\n    </external-authentication>\n    <local-authentication>\n        <enabled>false</enabled>\n    </local-authentication>\n\n    <expiration-warning>prompt</expiration-warning>\n</aaa>\nRestart NSO.\nservice ncs restart\nConfigure Default Authgroup Mappings\nIf the\ntokenLogin\nfeature of the Itential Platform NSO adapter will be used, verify the users all properly map to the proper southbound credentials. Itential Platform's reference configuration is accomplished by ensuring credentials are configured for the default\numap\ninside NSO. Run this command for each authentication group; be sure to apply the appropriate device credentials as the\nremote-name\nand\nremote-password\n.\nncs_cli -u admin -C\nconfig\ndevices authgroups group default default-map remote-name admin remote-password admin\ncommit\nSample NSO NACM Rules\nTo use Itential Platform with an NSO NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) implementation, you will need to reference the sample set of NACM rules provided with this package.\nThe NACM rules assume the following groups model.\nGroup\nDescription\npronghorn\nA NACM group applied to the user the NSO adapter will use when connecting with NSO.\nusers\nA NACM group applied to the user the NSO adapter will use when connecting with NSO.\nadmins\nA NACM group applied to administrators of the system.\nThese groups are shared across both Itential Platform and NSO. Using the sample external authentication script, Itential Platform will provide the set of groups defined inside Itential Platform and discovered from the configured AAA system to NSO to be applied to the NACM rule-lists.\nNote:\nIt is important that the set of groups returned by the NSO AAA provider properly match NACM rule-list group assignments.\nThe following rule-lists are provided in the sample rules.\nList\nDescription\npronghorn-system\nApplied to the Itential Platform\npronghorn\ngroup.\npronghorn-users\nApplied to the Itential Platform user groups.\nadmins\nApplied to\npronghorn\nand\nadmins\ngroups.\nBe sure to adjust the groups associated with these rule-lists to ensure they are mapped to the user accounts appropriately.\nInstall NACM Rules in NSO\nThe attached file\nsample-nacm-rules.xml\ncan be loaded into the NSO CDB using the\nload merge\nfeature of the\nncs_cli\n. Use the following commands to load the sample NACM rules.\nncs_cli -u admin -C\nconfig\nload merge sample-nacm-rules.xml\ncommit dry-run\ncommit\nConfigure Device Whitelists\nThe sample NACM rules contain a rule-list for whitelisting devices to the users group. Configure the sample rule-list or create your own rule-lists to associate devices with groups of users. Add devices to the users whitelist.\nncs_cli -u admin -C\nconfig\nnacm rule-list whitelist-devices rule permit-device-mydevicename path /devices/device[name='mydevicename'] action permit\ncommit\nNote:\nIn a NACM enabled system, any new device added to the system needs to have its groups defined at the time of device turn up. This applies to both manual configuration of the devices in NSO as well as any device turn up workflows that are turning up new devices on the network.\nConfigure Service Whitelists\nThe sample NACM rules contain a rule-list for whitelisting service instances to the users group. Configure the sample rule-list or create your own rule-lists to associate services with groups of users. Add all service instances for a model to the users whitelist.\nncs_cli -u admin -C\nconfig\nnacm rule-list whitelist-services rule permit-service-cisco-ios path /services/cisco-ios action permit\ncommit\nAlternately, you can add a single instance to the users whitelist.\nncs_cli -u admin -C\nconfig\nnacm rule-list whitelist-services rule permit-service-cisco-ios-101 path /services/cisco-ios[vlan=101] action permit\ncommit\nNote:\nIn a NACM enabled system, any new service instance added to the system needs to have its groups defined. Service instances may be restricted to an individual group or made accessible to multiple groups with the appropriate NACM rules.\nNSO NETCONF Events in Workflows\nConfigure workflows in Itential Platform to wait for Cisco NSO northbound NETCONF event notifications before proceeding.\nCisco NSO emits notifications over NETCONF for various events that occur within its system. The NSO Adapter can be configured to listen to NSO NETCONF event streams and the Itential Platform Event System can be configured to consume and process these events within a workflow.\nConfigure NSO NETCONF Event Streams\nEvent Streams are configured in NSO within the\nncs.conf\nfile. NSO allows the following event streams to be configured:\nncs-alarms\nncs-events\ndevice-notifications\nservice-state-changes\nNETCONF\nThis example shows how to configure an\nncs-alarms\nevents stream inside the NSO\nncs.conf\nfile.\n<notifications>\n    <event-streams>\n\n      <!-- This is the builtin stream used by NCS to generate northbound -->\n      <!-- notifications whenever the alarm table is changed. -->\n      <!-- See tailf-ncs-alarms.yang -->\n      <!-- If you are not interested in NCS northbound netconf notifications -->\n      <!-- remove this item since it does consume some CPU -->\n      <stream>\n        <name>ncs-alarms</name>\n        <description>NCS alarms according to tailf-ncs-alarms.yang</description>\n        <replay-support>false</replay-support>\n        <builtin-replay-store>\n          <enabled>false</enabled>\n          <dir>./state</dir>\n          <max-size>S10M</max-size>\n          <max-files>50</max-files>\n        </builtin-replay-store>\n      </stream>\n  </event-streams>\n</notifications>\nNote:\n: Every stream that is configured must be defined within\nncs.conf\nregardless if it supports replay. NSO logs notifications and a NETCONF client can ask for logged notifications if replay support is enabled.\nConfigure NSO Adapter to Listen to NETCONF Streams\nAdapter NSO can be configured to define which NSO NETCONF event streams to subscribe to. The list of event streams are defined in adapter properties, with the key\nnetconfSubscriptions\n. The NSO adapter must be restarted after the adapter properties are updated in order to listen to the NSO event streams. The\nnetconfSubscriptions\nvalues should correspond to the desired NSO NETCONF streams defined in NSO\nncs.conf\n.\nExample Configuration\nThis is an example of\nadapter-nso\nproperties with the\nnetconfSubscriptions\nkey defined.\n{\n        \"id\": \"NSO\",\n        \"type\": \"NSO\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"netconfSubscriptions\": [\n                \"ncs-events\",\n                \"ncs-alarms\",\n                \"device-notifications\",\n                \"service-state-changes\"\n            ],\n            \"http\": {\n                \"host\": \"localhost\",\n                \"port\": 8080\n            },\n            \"netconf\": {\n                \"host\": \"localhost\",\n                \"port\": 2022,\n                \"protocol\": \"ssh\"\n            },\n            \"ssh\": {\n                \"port\": 22\n            },\n            \"credentials\": {\n                \"user\": \"admin\",\n                \"passwd\": \"admin\"\n            },\n            \"commitWait\": 5000,\n            \"commitQueue\": false\n        },\n        \"groups\": [],\n        \"brokers\": [\n            \"device\",\n            \"method\",\n            \"service\"\n        ]\n    }\nWorkflow Configuration\nThe Workflow Engine\neventListener\ntask is used to listen for events from applications and adapters deployed inside the platform.\nFigure 1: Event Listener Task\nNote:\nRefer to the\neventListenerJob task reference\nfor more information.\nWhen a job is created, it will commence to process all the tasks that it can, but upon reaching the\neventListener\ntask it will wait in a\nrunning\nstate until it receives an event. The actual event that it is waiting for can be configured within the task itself.\nFigure 2: Event Listener Input Dialog\nDefined Event Listener Inputs\nInput\nDescription\nEvent Source\nThis is the application or adapter that will publish the event. For NSO notifications the NSO adapter will be the source and as the adapter is deployed in the\n@itential\nnamespace, it is important to provide the fully qualified location of the source. In the majority of cases you will use the value of\n@itential/adapter-nso\n; however, if you have multiple NSO adapters deployed then you need to ensure that you specify the correct adapter from which the event will be published.\nEvent Topic\nThis is the name of the topic to which the event will be published. For NETCONF this will be the name of the event stream. In the example dialog shown above, all events will be captured from the\nservice-state-changes\nNETFCONF stream.\nEvent Schema Filter\nBy adding a JSON schema to this field, the task can be configured to execute only when the event that it receives contains specific data that was defined by the schema filter. When the event is captured by the task, the payload of the event will be compared with the JSON schema defined in this field, and the task will only process if there is a match.\nEvent Schema Filter Examples\nThis example will process the\neventListener\ntask only when the following payload is received.\n{\n    \"eventTime\": \"2019-09-19T18:56:14.227091+01:00\",\n    \"plan-state-change\": {\n        \"service\": {\n            \"_\": \"/l3vpn:l3vpn-simple-svc[l3vpn:name='IAP']\"\n        },\n        \"component\": \"self\",\n        \"state\": {\n            \"_\": \"ncs:init\"\n        },\n        \"operation\": \"created\",\n        \"status\": \"reached\"\n    }\n}\nThe JSON schema for the\nEvent Schema Filter\nwould be defined as:\n{\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"eventTime\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"default\": \"2019-09-19T18:56:14.227091+01:00\",\n            \"examples\": [\n                \"2019-09-19T18:56:14.227091+01:00\"\n            ],\n            \"format\": \"date-time\"\n        },\n        \"plan-state-change\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"service\": {\n                    \"type\": \"object\",\n                    \"properties\": {\n                        \"_\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\",\n                            \"default\": \"/l3vpn:l3vpn-simple-svc[l3vpn:name='IAP']\",\n                            \"enum\": [\n                                \"/l3vpn:l3vpn-simple-svc[l3vpn:name='IAP']\"\n                            ]\n                        }\n                    },\n                    \"required\": [\n                        \"_\"\n                    ],\n                    \"additionalProperties\": false\n                },\n                \"component\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"default\": \"self\",\n                    \"examples\": [\n                        \"self\"\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"state\": {\n                    \"type\": \"object\",\n                    \"properties\": {\n                        \"_\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\",\n                            \"default\": \"ncs:init\",\n                            \"examples\": [\n                                \"ncs:init\"\n                            ]\n                        }\n                    },\n                    \"required\": [\n                        \"_\"\n                    ],\n                    \"additionalProperties\": false\n                },\n                \"operation\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"default\": \"created\",\n                    \"examples\": [\n                        \"created\"\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"status\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"default\": \"reached\",\n                    \"examples\": [\n                        \"reached\"\n                    ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"required\":\n                \"service\",\n                \"component\",\n                \"state\",\n                \"operation\",\n                \"status\"\n            ],\n            \"additionalProperties\": false\n        }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\n        \"eventTime\",\n        \"plan-state-change\"\n    ],\n    \"additionalProperties\": false\n}\nNote:\nIf there is no need to filter on the payload and you simply want the task to execute when it receives a specific\nEvent Topic\n, then an empty JSON object\n{}\nshould be set within the\nEvent Schema Filter\nfield.\nItential Tools Rules Engine\nThe Itential Tools Rules Engine allows users to define scripts that can be executed prior to NSO command-sets being executed. These scripts will modify (add or change) values in the NSO command-sets prior to their execution.\nThe rules engine has two parts: a rule engine and a script engine. The script engine reads the script files that have been defined for the command that is passed in, and then reads in the defined rules before it finally passes the rules to the rule engine to be processed.\nThe following files are required:\nFile\nName\nDescription\ncommand file\ndl_command.json\nThis file is used to associate the command name to the script name.\nrule script\n<name of the script>.dls\nThis file will define the script. It is generated by the user who creates the script.\nDevelopment Tools and Libraries\nThe following tools and libraries can be used for development and testing of the Itential Tools Rules Engine. The main framework for the Java-based application will be the Java Spring framework.\nTesting Tool\nDescription\nMockito\nA mocking framework for unit testing.\nTestNG\nA testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit that is designed to cover all categories of testing. The functionality of TestNG includes support for annotations and concurrent testing, along with several other features. TestNG requires JDK 7 or higher.\nSystem Design\nThe Itential Tools Rules Engine has three functional areas:\nScript Engine\nRule Engine\nScript Validation Engine\nFigure 3: Itential Tools Rules Engine Design\nScript Engine\nThe Script Engine is the main driver for script processing. It receives the command file that contains the request to modify the NSO command-set. The following processes are performed in the Script Engine:\nRead in the command file.\nLocate the command to get the script file to execute.\nRead in the script file that needs to be executed. This file will have the defined rules to execute against the NSO command-set.\nThe rule engine will be called to process the rules.\nThe NSO command-set will be modified appropriately.\nThe modified command-set will be returned to the calling system.\nAny errors encountered along the way will be handled appropriately and returned to the calling system.\nRule Engine\nThe Rule Engine is responsible for processing each rule. The input parameters will be the rule and the NSO command-set. The modified NSO command-set will be its output parameter. The following steps will be performed:\nReceive parameters.\nDetermine which rule to process.\nPerform the rule process and modify the NSO command-set.\nReturn the modified NSO command-set.\nHandle any errors and pass back to Script Engine for its error handler to process.\nScript Validation Engine\nThe Script Validation Engine will validate if the script has the correct format and the commands that are contained in the script are valid commands with the correct number of parameters required for the command type.\nIf any of the validations fail, a custom java exception will be thrown with the appropriate error message and code, and then passed back to the calling system to be handled appropriately.\nValidation\nDescription\nParameter (required)\nScript name.\nChecks\nEach command must be terminated with a semicolon. Each command will be validated for a valid number of parameters.\nValidation Commands\n$DLC_REPLACE\nFour (4) parameters:\n1st - Any String\n2nd - Any String\n3rd - Int value\n4th - Int Value\n$DLC_INSERT\nFive (5) parameters:\n1st - Any String\n2nd - Any String\n3rd - Before or After value\n4th - Int Value\n5th - Int value\nRule Command Format and Usage\nUsage\nFormat\nReplace\n$DLC_REPLACE(\"original string\",\"new string\", occurrence, num)\nInsert Before\n$DLC_INSERT(\"original string\",\"new string\",BEFORE, occurrence, num)\nInsert After\n$DLC_INSERT(\"original string\",\"new string\",AFTER, occurrence, num)\nArguments\nArgument\nDescription\noriginal string\nWhat the command is looking for.\nnew string\nWhat will be added. This will also support the following escape characters:\n\\t - tab, \\n - new line, \\r - return\n. Support of additional options as defined in the section \"Supported Options within the 'new string' Argument\" below.\noccurrence\nNumber that indicates the starting position of the original string before it begins to execute the rule. For example, if there are three (3) instances of the original string and the occurrence is two (2), then the command would start processing at instance two (2).\nnum\nNumber of times the action occurs 0-x (0=all of them).  For example, if there are 4 matches of original string and occurrence=3, then only the first three original strings will have the replacement.\nNote:\nIn this scenario, this works in conjunction with the Occurrence setting such that if Occurrence=3 and Num=3, then only two (2) replacements would occur (i.e. the third and fourth) although Num=3.\nSupported Options within the \"new string\" Argument\n$STRING\nSyntax:\n$STRING['my string'|'2nd string'|'3rd string']\nParameters:\n$STRING\n- A single value or and array or string separated by a a pipe (\"|\") symbol that will be printed out. An array will cause a loop will occur.\n$LOOP\nSyntax:\n$LOOP[{start}-{end}|$STRING['{string to print out}']$LOOP_VAR]\nParameters:\n{start}:[int]\n- The starting number of the loop.\n{end}:[int]\n- The ending number of the loop.\n{string to print out}:[string]\n- Any string you want to print out.\n$LOOP_VAR:[int]\n- The integer value of the current loop iteration that will be printed out where it appears either before or after the\n$STRING[]\noption.\nNote\n: Multiple references to\n$LOOP_VAR\nare allowed and supported.\nExample\n$DLC_INSERT(\"access-list\",\"new text here\",AFTER,1);\n$DLC_INSERT(\"access-list\",\"new text here\",BEFORE,1);\n$DLC_INSERT(\"\",\"\\n$LOOP[1-100|$STRING['vlan ']$LOOP_VAR]\\n\",AFTER,1,1);\n$DLC_INSERT(\"\",\"\\n$STRING['my string'|'2nd string'|'3rd string']\\n\",BEFORE,1,1)\nImplementation Design\nImplementation of the designed Rule Engine will include the following features:\nIntegration into the current\nitential-tools\njava application.\nA mechanism for the system to refresh the list of commands available to it without a required restart of\nitential-tools\n.\nAn option to bypass the refresh feature.\nThe ability of users to update the commands and scripts.\nRule Engine Integration\nTo integrate the new Rule Engine into the itential-tools application, the\njava jar file\ngenerated by the Rule Engine application would need to be included in the private-jar or the shared-jar directory to build the itential-tools application.\nThe\ncom.itential.datalore_utils.ScriptEngine\npackage would need to be imported into the class that is calling it. Below is a code sample to execute the command.\nimport com.itential.datalore_utils.ScriptEngine;\n\nScriptEngine scriptEngine = new ScriptEngine(sCommand, sNSOCommandSet);\n\ntry {\n    sNSOCommandSet = scriptEngine.processCommand();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\nIntegration Features\nFeature\nDescription\nRefresh command list\nCurrently, the command list is re-read every time processing of the command is executed.\nBypass option\nA configuration parameter called\nbypassRuleEngine\ncan be defined for\nitential-tools\nand passed to it. This would be defined in the application that is calling the feature set. If this parameter is not passed to itential-tools then a default value of TRUE would be set for the parameter and bypass this feature.\nUpdate command/script by user\nIn the first release of this feature, all commands/scripts will be manually created/edited and copied to the installed location. In the initial release, no will be UI available to support any script manipulation.\nConfigure NSO for SSL\nThe following steps provide instructions to configure SSL between NSO and Itential Platform.\nNSO SSL Configuration\nUpload NSO host and CA X.509 certificates to the NSO host\n$CERT_DIR\n.\nCopy the NSO host private key and signed certificate to the NSO configuration directory.\nNCS_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/ncs\ncp $NSO_SERVER_PRIV_KEY $NCS_CONFIG_DIR/ssl/cert/host.key\ncp $CERT_DIR/$NSO_SERVER_CERTIFICATE $NCS_CONFIG_DIR/ssl/cert/host.cert\nTrust the CA certificate and adjust for your platform.

We assume only one NSO instance manages a given device, and no other devices use that exact same name.\nItential does not support having multiple NSO instances having\nservice models\nof the same name/path. We assume only one NSO instance manages a given service model, and no other service models use that exact same name/path.\nAssuming the following LSA architecture:\nAn ‚Äúupper‚Äù NSO service that has service models defined.\nOne or more ‚Äúlower‚Äù NSO services that connect to devices.\nYou can then do the following setup in Itential Platform:\nCreate an\nadapter-nso\ninstance and point it to the upper node.\nCreate an additional\nadapter-nso\ninstance for every lower node and point it to a lower node.\nWith this setup, you should then be able to use service models (e.g., with tasks such as\nsaveInstances\n) and perform device management (e.g., with Configuration Manager).\nFor more context, NSO can also utilize an Itential Platform ‚Äúbroker‚Äù to further support this setup. When an app task like\nsaveInstances\nis used, you provide the device name to the task. At that point the Itential Platform broker will query all\nadapter-nso\ninstances to see which one has that service model, and then use that adapter instance. The same principle applies to any tasks which directly interact with devices. For example, the golden config feature in Configuration Manager utilizes a broker to know which\nadapter-nso\ninstances manage which device.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings":

Support was added for persistent redirect links across SAML SSO login flows to ensure users are restored to their original location after logging out and logging back in.\nENG-7728\nFixed an issue where the\nstatus\nfor each job was not reflected in the output objects from the childJob task when either parallel or sequential looping was enabled.\nENG-7900\nIn certain circumstances, the Workflow Builder Canvas would display duplicate task definitions in the task palette. This change provides a fix that eliminates possible race conditions and ensures no duplicates are added.\nENG-8062\nWhen configuring Azure/EntraID as an Identity Provider (IdP) in the Platform, the SSO test connection failed due to a required\nPassword, ProtectedTransport\nauthentication method. To resolve this issue, added a \"Disable Expected Auth\" toggle to the SSO configuration page that gives administrators the option to control the\ndisableAuthnContext\nconfiguration property that disables checking of\nAuthnContext\nin an SSO/SAML response.\nENG-10352\nA series of fixes have been implemented to address multiple issues that occurred when utilizing an incoming or outgoing JST schema. These issues have been resolved to ensure proper functionality at runtime.\nENG-10751\nResolved a JST bug that allowed references to deleted steps to persist within the context of other steps, ensuring that the integrity of the workflow remains intact and that users are not misled by outdated references.\nENG-12023\nAdded checks for\niap_id\nand Redis connection to ensure smooth shutdowns when exiting the Platform early in the startup process and when exiting the Platform after Redis shuts down.\nENG-12445\nWhen importing a pre-built automation with GBAC assigned, the imported automation does not appear in the Operations Manager side navigation bar. Fixed pre-built automation import to ensure all GBAC\nid\nare strings and the automation is displayed in the side navigation bar.\nENG-12529\nThe Command Template Builder UI previously lacked the Maximum Accepted Percentage (%) selector when performing a comparison evaluation by percentage. This issue has been rectified by re-adding the selector to the UI, ensuring its availability for use in command templates.\nENG-12586\nA new configurable timeout property,\nmaxIdleTimeMS\n, has been introduced to effectively drop unused connections, with a default setting of 5 minutes. This enhancement is designed to reduce the total number of connections during periods of lighter usage, particularly impacting select versions of Itential Platform.\nENG-12616\nWhen adding users to a Group via UI, the save button was greyed out (disabled). Implemented functionality in the Edit Group dialog so that when modifying group members through the Admin Essentials UI, the save button will now be enabled on member change.\nImprovements\nThis section highlights quality improvements to Itential Platform's functionality in this maintenance release.\nKey ID\nRelease Note\nENG-11965\nAdded a configurable parameter where users can set a timeout for initial startup Redis connection. The\nconnectTimeout\nand\nhandleConnectionTimeout\nsets the maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the initial Redis connection before timing out. If not set, defaults to 30000ms (30 seconds).\nENG-12523\nThe NSO adapter has been updated to incorporate a\nglobal-timeout\nsetting, which acts as a boolean flag. When set to 'true', this\nglobal-timeout\nsetting allows services to bypass local timeout values and instead adhere to the global timeout configuration. If the\nglobal-timeout\nis not activated or is set to 'false', the system will revert to either a custom value or the default timeout of 60 seconds, as specified by the user.\nENG-12595\nAdded\nworkflowId\nand\nprojectId\nproperties to the\njobStart\nevent in Workflow Engine. These unique identifiers help to correlate workflow executions (jobs), and protect against unexpected event duplication.\nENG-12662\nAdded a task\nsummary\nand\ndescription\nto Workflow Engine events. This metadata is automatically added to task events handled via the\neventSystem\n, allowing users to easily understand the purpose and details of each event.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Platform 6.0.5 Maintenance Release"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Release Notes"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Bug Fixes"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Improvements"}], "code_blocks": ["Password, ProtectedTransport", "handleConnectionTimeout"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-606-maintenance-release", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-604-maintenance-release"]}

To configure the connection pool when connecting to MongoDB, use the\nmaxPoolSize\nsetting under\nmongoProps\nwithin the properties.json file.\nThis setting limits the ability of each application or adapter to add connections to the connection pool. In other words, it regulates (limits) the maximum number of pooled connections that can be opened for every application and adapter. When the maximum number of connections is reached, no additional connections can be created (opened) in the connection pool. Modification of\nmaxPoolSize\nshould be done with careful testing, as any changes to this value can impact Itential Platform and workflow performance.\n‚ö†\nWe recommend the default value for this setting as very low values can significantly affect platform performance.

Instead, if Vault is configured, these propertes will be automatically encrypted. For example, to create a Vault secret for an Itential Platform profile with a\nmongodb.password\nproperty, all that is required is to call the API to create the profile, or create the profile in the UI, and ensure that the\nmongodb.password\nproperty is filled out in plaintext. This property will not be stored in the database, but instead stored in Vault. Likewise, to update that password, such as when key rotation is needed, simply calling the update API for profiles, or updating it via the UI, with the plaintext password included in the request body.\n‚ö†\nUsing\n$ENC\nor\n$SECRET\nsyntax for these properties is heavily discouraged, as no \"double encryption\" will ever be performed on those properties.\nAdapters\nIf an adapter has a property that will be automatically encrypted, this property will display in the form view as a value that is starred out (*****).\nFigure 1: Adapter Configuration\nIf this property already exists, or is being edited, differently-styled stars will appear for the value. From this view it is not possible to see the value that is being typed.\nFigure 2: Adapter Configuration Update\nIn the advanced view, it is possible to see the value being typed, although it will never be starred if it already exists. Instead, it will display as an empty string regardless of the actual value. It will also appear with a different tooltip display indicating it has an encrypted property.\nFigure 3: Adapter Configuration Advanced View\nIntegrations\nIf an integration has a property that will be automatically encrypted, this property will display in the form view as a starred out value. These encrypted properties are standardized based on the type of authentication used by the integration.\nFigure 4: Integrations Configuration\nIf this property already exists, or is being edited, differently-styled stars will appear for the value. From this view it is not possible to see the value that is being typed.\nFigure 5: Integrations Configuration Update\nIn the advanced view, it is possible to see the value being typed, although it will never be starred if it already exists. Instead, it will always display as an empty string. It will also appear with a different tooltip indicating it has an encrypted property.\nFigure 6: Integrations Configuration Advanced View\nApplications\nWhile most Itential applications do not have any properties that are configurable, thereby leading to no sensitive properties, it is possible for custom applications to have properties configured in the\npropertiesDecorators.json\nto always be encrypted. These will appear the same way as adapters and integrations in the Admin Essentials user interface.\nProfiles\nIf a profile has a property that needs to be automatically encrypted, such as the\nredisProps\npassword, it will display as a starred out value to indicate it is an encrypted property.\nFigure 7: Profile Property Masking\nÔÅö\nIf this property already exists, or is being edited,\ndifferently-styled stars\nwill appear for the value. The difference is subtle but is a visual indication between a pre-configured secret versus a field that hasn't yet been configured with a secret.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/platform-6-installation", "title": "Platform Installation", "text": "Platform Installation\nUpdated on\nJul 30, 2025\nPublished on Feb 27, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nThis guide will provide users instructions on how to do a fresh installation of Itential Platform 6.\nBefore starting, please review the\nPlatform 6 Configuration Enhancements Guide\n.\nRPM Distribution & Artifact Repository\nBeginning with Platform 6, Itential‚Äôs platform product is distributed as an RPM.\nBin\nand\ntar\nfiles are no longer supported by Itential nor are they offered as an artifact.\nRPM distribution is offered as follows. Repository access is managed by licensed permission. These repositories are accessible only if the customer has the appropriate license.\nRepository\nDescription\nPLATFORM\nThis repository offers RPM of Itential‚Äôs base product and includes: Studio, Operations Manager, and Configuration Management.\nCONFIG\nThis repository offers RPM of Itential‚Äôs Enterprise Configuration Management software, and includes Golden Configuration.\nLIFECYCLE\nThis repository offers RPM of Itential‚Äôs Lifecycle Manager product.\nSERVICE\nThis repository offers RPMs of Itential‚Äôs NSO Service Manager product.\nFigure 1: Itential Software Repository\nInstallation of Dependencies\nItential Platform depends on several components and requires them to be installed alongside the software on the same machine.\nRequired dependencies are provided here:\nItential Dependencies\nThis guide will reference the specific versions below:\nNode.js version 20\nPython 3.11\nPip for Python 3.11\n‚ö†\nIf a user attempts to install the Itential Platform RPM on a system which does not have the dependencies installed, the installation will fail.\nNode.js\nInstall Node.js on RHEL 8, RHEL 9, Rocky 8, and Rocky 9 from the official package repository.\ndnf module enable nodejs:20\ndnf install nodejs\nInstall Node.js on Amazon Linux 2023 from the official package repository. Note that Amazon Linux has added\nalternatives\ncompatibility to the\nnodejs\npackage, which installs major version 18, but not to the\nnodejs20\npackage required by Itential Platform. Please use the following command to set up an\nalternatives\nentry which points to the appropriate version of Node.js.\n# Install Nodejs 20\ndnf install nodejs20\n\n# Use 'node-20' as provider for 'node' with priority 1000\nalternatives --install /usr/bin/node node /usr/bin/node-20 1000 \\\n  --slave /usr/bin/npm npm /usr/bin/npm-20 \\\n  --slave /usr/bin/npx npx /usr/bin/npx-20\nPython 3.11\nInstall Python 3.11 on RHEL 8, RHEL 9, Rocky 8, Rocky 9, and Amazon Linux 2023\ndnf install python3.11 python3.11-pip\nPython Packages\nMethod 1: Installing Template Builder‚Äôs Python Dependencies to the Host System\nAfter installing the correct version of Python to the host system, install Template Builder's Python package dependencies with the following command. This may be run before or after installing the Platform.\npython3.11 -m pip install jinja2==3.1.2 markupsafe==2.1.4 textfsm==1.1.3\nThe following command may be used to verify the versions of the packages after installation:\npython3.11 -m pip list\nMethod 2: Installing Template Builder‚Äôs Python Dependencies to the Itential User\nAfter installing the Platform, install Template Builder‚Äôs Python dependencies to the\nitential\nuser using the following command. System-level packages will be unaffected.\nThis command cannot run before the Platform has been installed because the\nitential\nuser is created by the Platform installer.\nsu itential -c 'python3.11 -m pip install --user jinja2==3.1.2 markupsafe==2.1.4 textfsm==1.1.3'\nThe following command may be used to verify the versions of the packages after installation:\nsu itential -c 'python3.11 -m pip list --user'\nThe following command shows the Python packages installed to the host system. This may be used to verify that Template Builder's dependencies are installed only for the\nitential\nuser.\npython3.11 -m pip list\nInstallation of MongoDB & Redis Service Dependencies\nIn addition to the onboard dependencies listed above, Itential Platform requires two services to be running and accessible in order to start: MongoDB and Redis.\nSupported versions of MongoDB and Redis are provided here:\nItential Dependencies\nThis guide references the versions below:\nMongoDB 8.0\nRedis 7.4\nÔÅö\nThese services can be installed to the same machine as Itential Platform, but this is not required, and generally they should be run on dedicated machines.\nSELinux\n‚ö†\nThe supported Linux distributions come with SELinux pre-configured to work with MongoDB and Redis when installed in the default directories and using standard ports. Itential's validated designs and tests assume these directories and ports. Customers who choose to use custom, non-standard directories or ports will be required to configure SELinux.\nMongoDB\nThe following MongoDB documentation can be used for RHEL 8, RHEL 9, Rocky 8, and Rocky 9:\nInstall MongoDB Community Edition on Red Hat or CentOS\nThe MongoDB documentation describes variations in procedure which are specific to OS major version number, but only provides instructions for RHEL.\nFor Rocky Linux, match the OS major version number with that of RHEL.\nThe following MongoDB documentation can be used for Amazon Linux 2023:\nInstall MongoDB Community Edition on Amazon Linux\nRedis\nRedis 7.4 must be installed from source on RHEL 8, RHEL 9, Rocky 8, Rocky 9, and Amazon Linux 2023, as no official repository provides version 7.4 as of the time of this writing.\nThe official source installation instructions may be found here:\nInstall Redis from Source\nThe official source archive download server may be found here:\nhttps://download.redis.io/releases/\nÔÅö\nIf you run into a build error and get an error message like the one below, use\nmake distclean\nzmalloc.h:29:10: fatal error: jemalloc/jemalloc.h: No such file or directory\n #include <jemalloc/jemalloc.h>\nEnsure you have the required build tools and libraries installed:\ndnf install gcc make\n# For systemd support, add the systemd development package\ndnf install systemd-devel\n# For TLS support, add the OpenSSL development package\ndnf install openssl-devel\nObtain Redis source code. This example uses\nwget\n, but another download utility, such as\ncurl\n, may be substituted:\nwget https://download.redis.io/releases/redis-7.4.2.tar.gz\ntar -xzvf redis-7.4.2.tar.gz\ncd redis-7.4.2\nCompile the Redis source code. Ensure you use the appropriate build settings for your use case:\nBase build with no optional features:\nmake\nFor systemd support, add\nUSE_SYSTEMD=yes\nwhen building:\nmake USE_SYSTEMD=yes\nFor TLS support, add\nBUILD_TLS=yes\nwhen building. This may be combined with the systemd option:\nmake BUILD_TLS=yes USE_SYSTEMD=yes\nAfter building, install the resulting binaries:\nmake install\nVerify the installed version of Redis:\nredis-server --version\nConfigure Redis:\nmkdir -p /etc/redis\ncp ./redis.conf /etc/redis/redis.conf\n# Customize configuration for your use case\n$EDITOR /etc/redis.conf\nIf you compiled with\nsystemd\nsupport, create a service file from the template included in the source code, and customize it to your use case:\n# Add the service file to your Systemd service directory\ncp ./utils/systemd-redis_server.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/redis.service\n\n# If you created a configuration file above, reference it in 'ExecStart'\n# Recommended: Create and apply a dedicated 'redis' user for use with this service\n$EDITOR /usr/lib/systemd/system/redis.service\nReload the systemd daemon and start the newly installed\nredis\nservice:\nsystemctl daemon-reload\nsystemctl start redis\nInstallation of Platform 6\nOnce the installation of dependencies are completed, Platform 6 may be installed from the\nArtifact Repository\n.\nThere are several steps required to install and start the Itential Platform:\nInstall Itential Platform.\nInstall Lifecycle Manager, Enterprise Configuration Manager, or Service Manager if entitled to a license.\nCreate an encryption key.\nConfigure the Platform.\nInstall Platform 6 from Artifact\nVerify the Platform artifact has been downloaded from the customer repository to the target machine.\nOnce the artifact has been downloaded from the repository, run the command to install the\nPLATFORM\nartifact:\nrpm -Uh itential-platform-6.0.0-1.noarch.rpm\nÔÅö\nThis command assumes an artifact name of\nitential-platform-6.0.0-1.noarch.rpm\n. Please replace this name with the downloaded artifact name.\nThe product will be installed to the following directory:\n/opt/itential/platform/server\nThe installer creates the following directory. The customer is responsible for providing a\nplatform.properties\nfile in this location to define platform configuration.\n/etc/itential/\n‚ö†\nThe encryption key must be defined within the\nplatform.properties\nfile or Environment Variables for Platform 6 to function.\nInstallation of Lifecycle Manager, Enterprise Configuration Manager & Service Manager\nProvided that customers are licensed to access Lifecycle Manager, Enterprise Configuration Manager, and Service Manager, the following will assist with installation of those applications.\nDownload the relevant Artifacts from the Itential repository:\nLIFECYCLE\nSERVICE\nCONFIG\nFor artifact installation, an example showing Lifecycle Manager is shown below. This approach is practically identical for the Service Manager and Enterprise Configuration Manager applications. Once the artifacts are on the target system, installation may be accomplished by utilizing the following command:\nrpm -Uh itential-lifecycle_manager-VERSION.noarch.rpm\nÔÅö\nThe example above uses Lifecycle Manager for illustrative purposes. Please replace the artifact name with the relevant downloaded Lifecycle, Config Manager, or Service Manager artifact.\nThe assets will be installed to the following directory by default:\n/opt/itential/platform/services\nNSO Service Management\nThis task outlines the steps to support the build and installation of Itential Service Management RPM in Platform 6.\nÔÅö\nArchitecture Specific Artifacts for NSO Service Manager\nTo establish secure Netconf connections to NSO via\nssh2\n, architecture-specific libraries are required. Itential provides dedicated artifacts for both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures. Please ensure you select the artifact that corresponds to your target machine‚Äôs hardware architecture to guarantee full compatibility.\nDownload the\nitential-service_management-<version>.rpm\nbuild from the repository. An example showing version\n6.0.1\nis shown below.\nitential-service_management-6.0.1-rc1.aarch64.rpm\nUse the\ndnf\ninstall command to install the downloaded RPM:\nsudo dnf install itential-service_management-6.0.1-rc1.aarch64.rpm\n// Replace <version> with the actual version of the RPM file you downloaded.\nAfter installation, navigate to the\nservices\ndirectory:\ncd /opt/itential/platform/services\nVerify the following three NSO apps were installed:\nadapter-nso\napp-nso_manager\napp-service_management\nNext, move the NSO apps to the Itential Platform\nservices\ndirectory:\nmv /opt/itential/platform/services/* /opt/itential/platform/server/services\nYou will then verify the same three NSO apps are inside the IAP server services directory:\nls /opt/itential/platform/server/services\nLast, start your Itential Platform server:\ncd /opt/itential/platform/server\nnode server.js\nOnce the server is started, the NSO apps should be available and running within your Itential Platform instance.\nCreate the Encryption Key\nStarting with Platform 6, users are required to supply an encryption key in their configuration. Platform 6 will not start if an encryption key is not provided.\n‚ö†\nThe encryption key is used to secure secrets within the database. Itential\ndoes not\nmanage the lifecycle of this encryption key. The Platform will only read this key from configuration, and will not back it up in any way. Customers are responsible for recording the encryption key, and loss of the key will result in loss of all encrypted data.\nThe key value must be formatted as a 64 character hexadecimal string. For example:\n0000111122223333444455556666777788889999aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff\nThe following approaches may be followed for generating an encryption key:\nGenerating a randomized key value:\nopenssl rand -hex 32\nGenerating a key value using an existing password value as a base:\nprintf '%s' ‚Äú$PASSWORD‚Äù | sha256sum | head -c 64\nWhichever approach you use to generate the key, ensure the result is persisted in a secrets repository for safe keeping before applying it to your Itential Platform installation. Losing access to this key means losing access to secret values stored inside of Itential Platform.\n‚ö†\nImportant\nEncryption key\nMUST\nbe defined via environment variables or the\n.properties\nfile.\nEncryption key\nCANNOT\nbe set within profile. This is one of the few configuration parameters which is not configurable in all places.\nPlatform 6\nWILL NOT\nstart without an encryption key.\nConfiguration\nBeginning with Platform 6, Itential is no longer defining system and platform properties within a\nproperties.json\nfile.\nThe platform is now fully configurable via:\nOn-disk\nplatform.properties\nfile\nEnvironment Variables\nPlatform 6 continues to support database profiles and the legacy\nproperties.json\nfile, but recommends that the user transitions to Environment Variables or the\nplatform.properties\nfile.\nAdditional details on defining properties are available within the configuration section here:\nConfiguring Platform 6\nUsing platform.properties\nA template\nplatform.properties\nfile is included with the Platform at the following location:\n/opt/itential/platform/server/utils/template.properties\nUsers may continue to utilize a\nproperties.json\nfile by placing the file within the following directory:\n/opt/itential/platform/server\nStarting the Platform\nThe Itential Platform is installed as a\nsystemd\nservice, and may be started with the following command:\nsystemctl start itential-platform\nOffline Installation of Dependencies from RPMs\nIf your installation policy requires that the target machine is kept offline, Itential Platform dependencies may be installed directly from a downloaded RPM.\nThe\ndnf\npackage manager supports a download plugin for placing RPM into a local directory instead of installing them to the system:\nDNF download Plugin\nFollow the plugin documentation to obtain copies of the required RPMs in your filesystem, copy them to the target machine, and use\ndnf\nor\nrpm\nto install them on the offline system.\nRelated Reading\nPlatform

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/managing-aaa-sources-via-itential-platform-profiles", "title": "Managing AAA Sources via Itential Platform Profiles", "text": "Managing AAA Sources via Itential Platform Profiles\nUpdated on\nJan 21, 2025\nPublished on Aug 22, 2023\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nItential Platform supports integration with several Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) sources.  Upon initial installation of the Platform, the system uses a local AAA service as its source. This is often replaced with an external AAA source such as OpenLDAP or Active Directory Domain Services. Access to the Platform will be denied if the AAA source is unavailable.\nItential Platform supports the use of one active AAA source at a time; however, to provide a layer of redundancy, multiple AAA sources can be configured on the Itential Platform system. For example, if a Platform system is integrated with a single AAA source -- such as an LDAP server -- and that LDAP server becomes unavailable, users are unable to log in to Itential Platform. To prepare for such a scenario, a secondary AAA source can be configured. Operators may then manually switch to the secondary AAA source if the primary source becomes unavailable.\nWarning:\n‚ö†\nAAA sources cannot be federated by enabling multiple simultaneously. Doing so may prevent users from logging into  Itential Platform.\nIn this document, you will learn how to use  Itential Platform profiles to manage AAA sources. A best practice strategy for managing multiple AAA sources via these profiles will be outlined. The procedure for switching between these profiles will be detailed and should be well understood by operations teams.\nManaging AAA Sources via Profiles\nA profile designates the specific services (applications and adapters) that should be enabled on the  Itential Platform server. It is loaded on system startup as defined in the\nproperties.json file\n. When an application or an adapter is installed and configured, it can then be enabled or disabled per profile. As such, to manage multiple AAA sources via profile:\nThe relevant AAA adapters are configured on the Itential Platform system.\nThese adapters are added to separate  Itential Platform profiles.\nThe active Itential Platform profile is changed based on which AAA source is to be used.\nNote:\nOnly one Itential Platform profile may be active at any time. After making a new profile active,  Itential Platform must be restarted for the changes to take effect.\nConfiguring AAA Adapters\nFirst, all relevant AAA adapters must be configured.\nAdapters\nare the software components of Itential Platform that handle the sending and receiving of data to and from external systems. Data is delivered to an adapter via a mechanism within the Platform called a broker. A\nbroker\nis responsible for delivering certain types of data to an adapter. For example, AAA adapters (e.g., LDAP, AD, and RADIUS) must be configured with the\naaa\nbroker to receive AAA-specific requests.\nAdapters are configured via the\nAdapters\nmenu of\nAdmin Essentials\n:\nFrom the dashboard, launch the\nAdmin Essentials\napplication. This application is only available to administrator-level users.\nExpand\nAdapters\nvia the Admin Essentials side navigation menu.\nSelect the adapter that you would like to configure from the list that is displayed.\nThe configuration (sometimes known as the\nservice config\n) of the adapter will be shown.\nFigure 1\nshows an example configuration for the\nLocal AAA\nadapter.\nNote:\nAdvanced view\nhas been enabled in\nFigure 1\nto show the adapter configuration in JSON format. Advanced view can be enabled or disabled using the toggle in the upper-right corner.\nFigure 1: Adapter Configuration\nBy default, the Local AAA adapter is configured to point to the MongoDB datastore that was specified during Itential Platform installation. The most important component of the\nService Config\nin\nFigure 1\nis on line 28. Note that\naaa\nis configured within the\nbrokers\narray.  This means that any incoming request to authenticate with  Itential Platform will be directed to this adapter. In turn, the adapter will search the local MongoDB datastore for a match to the username and password sent in the authentication request.\nProper setup of each required AAA adapter is crucial. All relevant AAA adapters should be configured and tested before proceeding.\nCreating Profiles\nAfter all relevant AAA adapters have been configured, multiple Itential Platform profiles must be created -- one for each of the AAA adapters to be used. Profiles are created via the\nProfiles\nmenu of\nAdmin Essentials\n. To create a new profile, you will need to clone the default profile:\nFrom the dashboard, launch the\nAdmin Essentials\napplication.\nExpand\nProfiles\nvia the Admin Essentials side navigation menu.\nSelect the default profile from the list that is displayed. In most cases, the default profile is\nprofile1\n.\nClick the\nmenu\nbutton (stacked dots) at the upper-right corner of the window. Select\nClone\nfrom the menu to open the clone modal.\nEnter the desired name for the new profile, then click the\nClone\nbutton at the bottom-left of the modal. Itential recommends naming the cloned profile in such a way that the AAA source it uses is readily apparent.\nCreating a new profile by cloning the default profile ensures that all required running properties and server configurations are included.\nIn the following example (\nFigure 2\n), two (2) profiles were created by cloning the default profile:\nLDAP\nand\nLocalAAA\n.\nFigure 2: Cloning the Default Profile\nConfiguring Profiles\nNext, the newly created profiles must be configured:\nFrom the dashboard, launch the\nAdmin Essentials\napplication.\nExpand\nProfiles\nvia the Admin Essentials side navigation menu.\nSelect the profile you would like to edit (configure) from the list that is displayed.\nClick the\nConfigure\ntab located near the top of the window.\nFrom the\nConfigure\ntab, adapters can be enabled or disabled via the\nAdapters\noption (accessed beneath the\nEdit Profile Services\nheader). To enable an adapter:\nSelect the checkbox for the adapter.\nClick the\nSave\nicon (\nÔÉá\n) in the upper-left corner.\nIn the following example (\nFigure 3\n), the\nLocalAAA\nprofile created in the\nprevious section\nhas been selected for configuration. The\nLocal AAA\nadapter has been enabled via checkbox - all other AAA adapters remain disabled (unchecked).\nFigure 3: Local AAA Profile Configuration\nIn\nFigure 4\n, the\nLDAP\nprofile has been selected for configuration and enabled (checked).\nFigure 4: LDAP Profile Configuration\nSwitching Between Profiles\nOnce all profiles are configured, operators may switch between them to determine which AAA source is used by the Platform. To change an active Itential Platform profile:\nFrom the dashboard, launch the\nAdmin Essentials\napplication.\nExpand the\nProfiles\nvia the Admin Essentials side navigation menu.\nSelect the profile you would like to make active from list that is displayed.\nClick the\nmenu\nbutton (stacked dots) in the upper-right corner.\nSelect\nView Metadata\nfrom the menu to open the metadata drawer.\nClick the\nActive Profile\ntoggle to mark the selected profile as the active profile (\nFigure 5\n).\nClick the\nSave\nbutton at the bottom-left of the metadata drawer. A success banner will display, prompting you to restart Itential Platform.\nRestart the Platform server. For Itential Platform environments utilizing MongoDB replica sets,\nall\nPlatform servers reading data from the MongoDB database will need to be restarted.\nWarning:\n‚ö†\nIn some Itential Platform versions, the active AAA adapter is prevented from loading properly if any other AAA adapter is using the\n\"aaa\" broker\n. As a recommended precaution, be sure the \"aaa\" broker is\nonly\npresent in the configuration of the AAA adapter to be used.\nFigure 5: Enabling a Profile\nDirectly Editing the Profile via properties.json\nItential recommends changing the profile configuration via the UI whenever possible. However, if an unavailable AAA source has made Itential Platform inaccessible, the active profile can be changed by editing the\nproperties.json\nfile:\nNavigate to the\nproperties.json\nfile (located in\n$IAP_HOME/current\n) and open it via text editor.\nFind the configuration line for\nid\n(e.g.,\n\"id\": \"LDAP\"\n).\nChange the value of\nid\nto the name of the desired profile (e.g.,\n\"id\": \"LocalAAA\"\n).\nRestart the Itential Platform server.\nAppendix A:\nproperties.json\nMost configuration properties for Itential Platform are stored in named profiles. In turn, these profiles are stored in the MongoDB database used by the Platform as a datastore.\nThe\nproperties.json\nfile (\n$IAP_HOME/current/properties.json\n) referred to throughout this document provides the Platform with two main pieces of information:\nThe location of the MongoDB database that is used as a data store.\nThe name of the profile within that data store that is active when the server starts.\nThe following is an example\nproperties.json\nfile that is loading the\nLocal_AAA\nprofile from a local installation of MongoDB.\n{\n  \"pathProps\": {\n    \"description\": \"File Path Variables\",\n    \"sdk_dir\": \"/opt/pronghorn-applications\",\n    \"encrypted\": true\n  },\n  \"id\": \"Local_AAA\",\n  \"mongoProps\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"passwd\": \"itentialPassword\",\n      \"user\": \"itentialUser\"\n    },\n    \"db\": \"pronghorn\",\n    \"url\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\"\n  }\n}\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Managing AAA Sources via Itential Platform Profiles"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Managing AAA Sources via Profiles"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Configuring AAA Adapters"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Creating Profiles"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Configuring Profiles"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Switching Between Profiles"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Directly Editing the Profile via properties.json"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Appendix A:properties.json"}], "code_blocks": ["$IAP_HOME/current/properties.json", "{\n  \"pathProps\": {\n    \"description\": \"File Path Variables\",\n    \"sdk_dir\": \"/opt/pronghorn-applications\",\n    \"encrypted\": true\n  },\n  \"id\": \"Local_AAA\",\n  \"mongoProps\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"passwd\": \"itentialPassword\",\n      \"user\": \"itentialUser\"\n    },\n    \"db\": \"pronghorn\",\n    \"url\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\"\n  }\n}", "{\n  \"pathProps\": {\n    \"description\": \"File Path Variables\",\n    \"sdk_dir\": \"/opt/pronghorn-applications\",\n    \"encrypted\": true\n  },\n  \"id\": \"Local_AAA\",\n  \"mongoProps\": {\n    \"credentials\": {\n      \"passwd\": \"itentialPassword\",\n      \"user\": \"itentialUser\"\n    },\n    \"db\": \"pronghorn\",\n    \"url\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\"\n  }\n}"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/large-data-in-jobs-and-tasks-best-practice", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/querying-form-data-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/managing-aaa-sources-via-itential-platform-profiles#appendix-a-propertiesjson", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/managing-aaa-sources-via-itential-platform-profiles#creating-profiles", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/managing-aaa-sources-via-itential-platform-profiles#configuring-aaa-adapters"]}

The installation destination (folder) differs between Platform 6 and the Itential Platform releases (22.1/23.1/23.2).\nMigration to Platform 6\nTo migrate, move and copy adapters from your current (legacy) Itential Platform version to the new Platform 6 release:\nLocate adapters on your current Itential Platform system.\n/opt/itential/pronghorn/node_modules/@ itentialopensource\nGo into an individual adapter.\ncd adapter-name\nRemove the\nnode_modules\ndirectory.\nrm -rf node_modules\nRemove the\npackage-lock.json\n.\nrm package-lock.json\nChange directory out of the adapter.\ncd ..\nPackage and compress the adapter you are working on (\nzip\n,\ngzip\n,\ntar\n).\nMove the compressed adapter to the new Platform 6 system.\nChange adapter directory to the Platform 6 Services directory.\n/opt/itential/platform/services\nDecompress the compressed file into the adapter directory. The services directory should contain the individual adapters and not a namespace.\nRepeat steps 1-9 for all adapters on the current Itential Platform, including any custom adapters that are located in a custom namespace.\nFollow steps 3 and 4 in the adapter installation section below for each adapter.\nWhen you have migrated all of your adapters to Platform 6, follow steps 5-9 of the install below. This is so you will only need to restart the platform once after all adapters have been migrated.\nInstallation\nTo install an adapter:\nGo to the Itential Platform Services directory:\ncd /opt/itential/platform/services\nClone, unzip, or tar the adapter into your Itential Platform environment. Use one of the methods below:\ngit clone git@gitlab.com:@itentialopensource/adapters/adapter-name\nunzip adapter-name.zip\ntar -xvf adapter-name.tar\nInstall the adapter dependencies:\ncd adapter-name\nnpm install\nLint and test the adapter:\nnpm run lint:errors\n- There should be none.\nnpm run test\n- All tests should pass.\nRestart the Itential Platform.\nRun the following to confirm restart:\nsystemctl restart itential-platform\nCreate an adapter service instance in the Itential Platform Admin Essentials GUI.\nConfigure a service instance configuration for the adapter in the Itential Platform Admin Essentials GUI.\nCopy the properties from the\nsampleProperties.json\nin the adapter directory and place into the inner (second) properties in the Admin Essentials Service Instance Configuration for the adapter.\nMake all specific changes such as\nhost\n,\nport\n, authentication method, credentials, etc.\nSet the\nadmin\npermission role to the adapter for anyone:\nBuilding workflows containing an adapter task.\nUsing calls into the adapter for retrieving dynamic data in a JSON form, or within other custom applications.\nUsage\nOnce the adapter has been installed, configured, and permissions set to the appropriate role, the adapter and its tasks should be available to users of the Itential Platform. Moreover, adapters are flexible with a high degree of customization for a variety of needs and use cases:\nYou can add tasks to a workflow in Automation Studio and then run that workflow.\nYou can add dynamic dropdowns that retrieve the list of data from an adapter.\nYou can integrate the adapter with the Device Broker, which will add devices to Configuration Manager.\nYou can access the adapter methods from your custom applications.\nYou can access the adapter methods through Itential Platform API calls.\nLimitations & Workarounds\nA call must exist in the adapter in order to be available. As vendors update APIs, the calls may be missing from adapters. When this occurs, you can use the generic adapter tasks to prevent being blocked while a call is added.\nAlmost all open source adapters come with generic adapter calls that allow you to define endpoints and parameters. These calls can be used when a call is missing from an adapter, or when call parameters have changed. It further allows you to make progress on your use cases while the adapter is being updated to support the additions.\nFurther adapter documentation can be found in the Itential Opensoure library space:\nAdapters\n.\nLogging\nAdapter debug logs are essential to triage adapter issues. The debug logging that's been enabled includes: OPTIONS, REQUEST and CALL RETURN.\nLog\nDescription\nOPTIONS\nThis logs out most of the information for the call made to the downstream system.\nREQUEST\nThis logs out the payload for the request to the downstream system.\nCALL RETURN\nThis is the raw data that the adapter got back from the downstream system.\nTesting\nOnce the adapter has been installed:\nBuild and run a workflow with some simple calls.\nCreate a JSON form and add a dynamic dropdown that utilizes an adapter call.\nFor device broker integration:\nEnsure the system has devices (e.g., Meraki) and there's access to the system.\nGo to the Admin Essentials GUI to verify broker integration for the adapter through the service instance configuration.\nGo to Configuration Manager to see if it was able to discover the devices in the down stream system. If not, you may need to confirm the device broker mappings in the adapter.\nTroubleshooting & Support\nTypical adapter issues center around configuration and authentication. The adapter\nsampleProperties\nshould have authentication techniques that were previously used or were documented to work with the adapter. In addition, every open source adapter should have an\nAUTH.md\nfile that describes the login process and criteria.\nWhen using SSL/TLS, you will need to enable SSL in the adapter service instance configuration.

The\nreplacement\nproperty is\nserverId\n.\nRefer to ‚ûü\nDeprecation of the ServerName Property\nThe\nserverName\nproperty allows administrators to define a uniquely identifying name for each Itential Platform server in their environment.\nProperty Name\nType\nDescription\nserverName\nString\nSpecifies the name that the server uses to identify itself. Any valid string can be used, but it is suggested that each name is unique to its environment. If a string is not provided,\nserverName\ndefaults to using a hashed value derived from the MAC address and Itential Platform port values of the server.\nNote:\nThe\n/status\nAPI call returns the name of the server containing the current database. If\nserverName\nis missing or invalid, the\n/status\nAPI will return a null reference value.\nSample Configurations\nThe configuration examples presented below show unique names that easily identify each server.\nExample 1\n\"serverName\": \"ecs-1.example.com\"\nExample 2\n\"serverName\": \"ECSH01234\"\nServerId Property\nThe\nserverId\nproperty allows admins to define a uniquely identifying name for each Itential Platform server in their environment. The\nserverId\nvalue is set in the properties.json file, and it provides a user-friendly, consistent way to set a server name. Moreover, by using\nserverId\nvalues, admins no longer have to rely on generated IP addresses. Lastly,\nserverId\nvalues can be utilized in a Blue-Green deployment.\nSample Configurations\nSingle Server\nThis example shows a unique name to easily identify the server.\n\"serverId\": \"iap-1\"\nMulti-Server\nThis advanced configuration shows three (3) unique server names in a primary data center and three (3) in a secondary data center.\nPRIMARY DATACENTER\n\"serverId\": \"IAP1.primary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP2.primary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP3.primary\"\nSECONDARY DATACENTER\n\"serverId\": \"IAP1.secondary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP2.secondary\"\n\"serverId\": \"IAP3.secondary\"\nImplementing the ServerId\nWhen changing (or adding) the\nserverId\nvalue while restarting Itential Platform, any tasks in the ‚Äúrunning‚Äù state that are\nNOT\nin the task types list below will be orphaned.\nTask Types\n- childJob\n- manual\n- forEach\n- eventListener\nThis will only be an issue when the\nserverId\nvalue is first set or changed.

Itential recommends that admins pause the task worker and have no running jobs when setting the\nserverId\n.\nIf an Itential Platform stack has a Disaster Recovery (DR) implementation, it is important to ensure the DR Itential Platform cluster does not contain duplicate\nserverId\nvalues from the primary cluster. At the moment, Itential Platform only checks for duplicate serverIds at the cluster level, not the global level.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/shared-token-redis-sentinel-itential-platform", "title": "Shared Token (Redis/Sentinel)", "text": "Shared Token (Redis/Sentinel)\nUpdated on\nJan 23, 2025\nPublished on Sep 25, 2024\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nOne of the requirements of a large scale web application is the ability to utilize load balancers to control user access to the application. A key component of successful high availability is to ensure that users can transfer from one Itential Platform server to another without having to login again. To avoid this, Itential Platform must store all login tokens in a shared location. To facilitate this, the Itential Platform High Availability system utilizes a Redis/Sentinel solution in a Master/Slave configuration to keep tokens available to all Itential Platform servers. This solution also provides failover capabilities between Itential Platform servers in the event a single Redis server should fail.\nNote:\nThe following is a living document of information that is continually revised and updated. As such, it may not complement the Itential Platform Installation Guide precisely. We recommend that you check for additional updates and if any questions, please contact Itential Product Support.\nPrerequisite Reading:\nPlease consult the Redis documentation for a full description on installation, configuration, and operation of Redis/Sentinel configuration.\nRedis Installation\nHigh Availability with Redis Sentinel\nRedis Replication\nRecommended Configuration\nOur recommendation for Shared Token Redis is to use three (3) Redis and three (3) Sentinels. The number of servers recommended is three (3) per data center with a single Redis/Sentinel on each server. This provides the best combination of failover and support.\nExample: Basic Master Config\n/etc/redis.conf\nbind <current server ip> 127.0.0.1\nrequirepass \"<SecretPassword>\"\nmasterauth \"<SecretPassword>\"\nExample: Basic Slave Config\n/etc/redis.conf\nbind <current server ip> 127.0.0.1\nrequirepass \"<SecretPassword>\"\nmasterauth \"<SecretPassword>\"\nslaveof <master server ip> 6379\nExample: Basic Sentinel Config\n/etc/redis-sentinel.conf\nbind <current server ip> 127.0.0.1\nport 26379\nsentinel monitor <redis cluster name> <master redis server ip> 6379 2\nsentinel down-after-milliseconds <redis cluster name> 10000\nsentinel failover-timeout <redis cluster name> 30000\nsentinel auth-pass <redis cluster name> \"<SecretPassword>\"\nItential Platform Specific Configuration\nTo manage failover Itential recommends the following settings be set on the Redis/Sentinel configuration. The will lower the failover times between Redis servers when the Sentinel detects a Redis is offline. This is done to ensure no delay in the user experience while the failover takes place. The provided values are recommended based on internal test cases.\n/etc/redis-sentinel.conf\nsentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 10000\nsentinel failover-timeout mymaster 30000\nSecurity Recommendations\nSecurity characteristics and recommendations for a Shared Token Redis configuration are outlined as follows.\nEncryption\nOut-of-the box Itential Platform to Redis communications lack the functionality to enable SSL encryption due to a current limitation of the Redis application. Redis is currently working to resolve this issue, and details on this can be found here:\nRedis Encryption\n. Because of this limitation, Itential strongly recommends that Shared Token Redis servers have all network access blocked from all outside access other than from Itential Platform servers. The Itential Platform Token should be considered sensitive and confidential information.\nTLS is supported by Redis after version 6. However, to build TLS capability into Redis, compile-time flags must be used.\nIn situations with disaster recovery or a second data center, Itential recommends separate Redis/Sentinel setups each connected to the Itential Platform servers in their data center. This means that Itential Platform servers will only share security tokens with the Itential Platform servers in their data center. Sharing tokens between data centers is not recommended due to the lack of encryption and performance.\nPasswords\nIn addition to network security, Itential recommends that passwords be enabled on Redis servers to help limit access to the token data. The Redis servers, once configured to use a password, will require the password before any access is granted to the tokens stored internally.\nItential recommends installing Redis as described here in\nHighly Available Redis\n.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Shared Token (Redis/Sentinel)"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Recommended Configuration"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Example: Basic Master Config"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Example: Basic Slave Config"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Example: Basic Sentinel Config"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Itential Platform Specific Configuration"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Security Recommendations"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Encryption"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Passwords"}], "code_blocks": ["bind <current server ip> 127.0.0.1\nrequirepass \"<SecretPassword>\"\nmasterauth \"<SecretPassword>\"", "bind <current server ip> 127.0.0.1\nrequirepass \"<SecretPassword>\"\nmasterauth \"<SecretPassword>\"", "bind <current server ip> 127.0.0.1\nrequirepass \"<SecretPassword>\"\nmasterauth \"<SecretPassword>\"\nslaveof <master server ip> 6379", "bind <current server ip> 127.0.0.1\nrequirepass \"<SecretPassword>\"\nmasterauth \"<SecretPassword>\"\nslaveof <master server ip> 6379", "bind <current server ip> 127.0.0.1\nport 26379\nsentinel monitor <redis cluster name> <master redis server ip> 6379 2\nsentinel down-after-milliseconds <redis cluster name> 10000\nsentinel failover-timeout <redis cluster name> 30000\nsentinel auth-pass <redis cluster name> \"<SecretPassword>\"", "bind <current server ip> 127.0.0.1\nport 26379\nsentinel monitor <redis cluster name> <master redis server ip> 6379 2\nsentinel down-after-milliseconds <redis cluster name> 10000\nsentinel failover-timeout <redis cluster name> 30000\nsentinel auth-pass <redis cluster name> \"<SecretPassword>\"", "sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 10000\nsentinel failover-timeout mymaster 30000", "sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 10000\nsentinel failover-timeout mymaster 30000"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/bluegreen-deployment-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/highly-available-architecture-server-specs", "https://redis.io/docs/manual/replication/", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/high-availability-itential-platform#highly-available-redis"]}

Click on the question to expand the content to show the response.\nSetting Up the Application\nHow do you install the Itential ServiceNow Application?\nYou may install the app from the\nServiceNow Store\n. For more information on how to install the application, please reference\nInstalling the Itential ServiceNow Application\n.\nWhat configurations need to occur in Itential to use the app?\nThere are no configurations that need to take place however, there are other factors to be aware of.\nAfter installation, you should be able to access Itential from the ServiceNow platform. If this is not the case, please contact your system admin.\nIf the user does not have an Itential Platform authenication token (this token is provided by the Itential Platform admin), they will have to enter their Itential Platform credentials to use the app.\nHow are levels of access defined in the Itential Automation Services app?\nThere are two access levels defined by the x_itent_services.admin and the x_itent_services.user roles.\nThe x_itent_services.admin role allows the user to assign roles and permissions.\nThe x_itent_services.user grants users access to the application.\nFor more information on how to set up roles, please refer to\nAssigning Roles\n.\nHow do you set restrictions on what information is available to users?\nAdmins may set restrictions by assigning particular roles to Itential Platform Instances in the Instances Config table. For more information on how to set restrictions, please refer to\nPermission Settings\n.\nWhat is the data flow pattern and specifications  (firewall ports, etc.) required for the app to work?\nThe Itential API is called from the ServiceNow Server. This is a change from the initial version of the Itential ServiceNow Application which connected to Itential from the Client's browser. This means that the ServiceNow instance needs access to Itential. Firewall rules must allow ServiceNow to access the Itential directly or through a MID Server.\nCommunication & Data Flow\nHow does the Itential Automation Services app communicate with Itential and update exposed forms?\nThe app is pre-programed to access the Operations Manager API using the provided URI in the configuration section.\nAre there any use cases where Itential requires more custom database tables?\nYes, after installation two tables are created. The first table is created to store Itential Platform instances and configurations.\nA second table is created to store information about the triggered automation such as, who triggered the automation, why the automation was triggered, and which Itential Platform instance the automation triggered aganist.\nHow will the Itential Automation Services app help address business processes when managing items within ServiceNow?\nUsers are able to use the Itential ServiceNow app to trigger automations within Itential.\nHow do I integrate Itential into other areas of ServiceNow?\nItential has provided ServiceNow Actions and example ServiceNow Flows that show how you can integrate Itential into your ServiceNow Change, Incident and Request processes. The provided Actions can be reutilized in Flows that you build using the ServiceNow Flow Designer.\nConnecting\nWhat happens if the Itential Automation Services app is having trouble connecting to Itential?\nIf connectivity is delayed the application will notify the user and ask them to retry the task they were trying to perform.\nSupport\nWho do I contact for support?\nYou may request technical support by clicking on\nItential Service Desk\nand submitting a form. \n  For more information on requirements to submit a form, please refer to\nItential Service Desk Information\npage.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "FAQ"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Setting Up the Application"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Communication & Data Flow"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Connecting"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Support"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/troubleshooting", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-developers-devguides", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/installation-itential-snow", "https://docs.itential.com/opensource/docs/assigning-roles-itential-snow", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/configuration#permission-settings"]}
{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-admin-essentials-managing-integrations", "title": "Managing Integrations", "text": "Managing Integrations\nPublished on Apr 28, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nAn Integration is a connectivity between Itential and another system (similar to an Adapter). Moreover, it is an instantiation of an Integration Model whereby the Integration uses specific properties from the Model to connect with specific systems. From Admin Essentials, the user interactions for creating and configuring Integrations occur primarily through the dialog views for\nIntegrations\nand\nIntegration Models\n, respectively. Please note that available views, features, and interactions in the UI can be limited based on user permissions.\nSee related page\n‚ûü\nIntegration Models\nCreating Integrations Using Integration Models\nTo create an integration, click the plus (+) sign in the top-left toolbar of Admin Essentials to open the\nCreate\ndialog. Alternately, from the Integration Model details view, you can click the\n+ Integration\nbutton.\nSelect the appropriate\nIntegration Model\nand click the\nSave\nbutton. You will be redirected to another dialog where you select the appropriate\nIntegration Model\nto create and configure your Integration.\nFigure 1: Create Integration\nFigure 2: New Integration from Integration Model\nConfiguring Integration Properties\nFrom the details view, if your integration has properties to edit, they will be displayed here in a form under the\nConfiguration\ntab. If not, properties can be configured and edited in the\nAdvanced View\n(if the user has been granted permission through the generic\nIntegrations - updateIntegration\nmethod). The\nAdvanced View\neditor is enabled (displayed) by using the toggle switch in the upper-right corner.\nFigure 3: Integration Properties\nFrom the\nAdvanced\nview, the\nMore\nbutton (stacked dots icon) next to the toggle switch can be used to clone or delete an integration if the user has been granted permission. Authorization to clone an integration is set with the\nIntegrations - createIntegration\npermission method. To delete, the\nIntegrations - deleteIntegration\nmethod is used.\nFigure 4: Advanced Configuration View\nSSL Configuration for Integrations\nItential has created two SSL configuration properties for Integrations:\nenabled\nand\nrejectUnauthorized\n. These properties are used when making integration requests to a service even if it has an invalid TLS certificate.\nProperty Schema\n\"tls\":{\n   \"enabled\":false,\n   \"rejectUnauthorized\":false\n}\nThe schema allows an integration instance to have configurable TLS properties to enable/disable the\nrejectUnauthorized\nproperty. This will allow users to bypass HTTPS TLS certificate checks.\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\nenabled\nBoolean\nFalse\nEnables certificate request from endpoint and verify retrieved certificate.\nrejectUnauthorized\nBoolean\nFalse\nIf true, the request will reject a connection that is not authorized with valid CAs. This option only has an effect if \"enabled\" is on.\nIntegration Logging\nLog Levels are controlled by configurations within Admin Essentials. Increasing the size of the log level under the\nLogging\ntab will impact\nall of Itential Platform\n, not just Integrations.\nMoreover, if the Syslog properties are not configured in the Advanced View of the Integration, the user will be unable to change that property in the Logging tab.\nRelated Reading:\nEvent Logs & Logging\nItential Developers: Log Class\nIntegration Responses\nWhenever an integration makes a call, and that call fails to connect to an external system, the information that's necessary for troubleshooting the failed integration task is now viewable by Itential Platform users, including the:\nMethod and action (GET, POST, PATCH, etc)\nURL (protocol, host, basepath, path)\nResponse object (status code, body)\nDebugging information\nThis feature enhancement applies to both on-premises and cloud Itential Platform users to ensure they receive the diagnostic information that's needed for troubleshooting when an integration call fails.\nOutput Errors\nWhen an Integration task is not successful in its call to an external system, an output error is returned along with useful information to help troubleshoot the error that is presented.\nWhen the Integration task fails because it does not have the proper information to make the API call, it will output the error as a\nstring\n, with a message to indicate why it could not make the API call.\nWhen the Integration task fails because the API call was processed by the target server and returned a failure, it will output the error as an\nobject\nwith fields in its response body.\nResponse Body\nItential has standardized the response body of an Integration task with additional information to help understand why an output error was returned.\nResponse Field\nDescription\nok\nBoolean value stating whether the response was successful.\nmethod\nHTTP verb that indicates the type of call, e.g.,\n\"method\": \"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"PATCH\", \"DELETE\"\nurl\nThe URL of the call that failed, e.g.,\n\"url\": \"https://server.com/api/v1/some/resource\"\nstatus\nThe HTTP status code returned by the server.\nstatusText\nDescription of the HTTP status code.\nheaders\nAn array of response headers of the call.\nbody\nThe body of the response. Provides information when Itential Platform is able to parse the response. If the error response is not JSON, Itential Platform is not able to parse the response, and the response is then conveyed to a\ntext\nfield.\ntext\nGenerated when Itential Platform cannot parse the body of the response.\nparseError\nRaised when a parsing error has occurred.\n‚ìò\nNote:\nFor some workflows, e.g.\nclientCredentials\n, the Itential platform will automatically request new access tokens or use refresh tokens. This may result in an error whereby the Integration task was a\n\"GET\"\nbut the error object was induced by a\n\"POST\"\nto\n\"api/v1/token\"\n. In this scenario, because the token request failed, the Integration could not even attempt the API call, which is why an error object is returned.\nExample: Success Response Body\nA\nSuccessful\nsample response body is presented below.\n{\n  \"ok\": true,\n  \"method\": \"GET\",\n  \"url\": \"http://localhost:8088/pet/7119\",\n  \"status\": 200,\n  \"statusText\": \"OK\",\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"connection\": \"close\",\n    \"content-type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"date\": [\n      \"Fri\",\n      \"05 May 2023 17:48:43 GMT\"\n    ],\n    \"transfer-encoding\": \"chunked\",\n    \"x-powered-by\": \"Express\"\n  },\n  \"body\": {\n    \"id\": 7119,\n    \"tags\": [],\n    \"status\": \"available\",\n    \"name\": \"Lotus\",\n    \"photoUrls\": [\n      \"https://patchpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatIsanAmericanBlackLab.jpg.webp\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\nExample: Error Response Body\nA sample\nError\nresponse body is presented below.\n{\n  \"ok\": false,\n  \"url\": \"https://petstore.swagger.io/api/v3/store/invenxxxtory\",\n  \"status\": 404,\n  \"statusText\": \"Not Found\",\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"access-control-allow-headers\": [\n      \"Content-Type\",\n      \"api_key\",\n      \"Authorization\"\n    ],\n    \"access-control-allow-methods\": [\n      \"GET\",\n      \"POST\",\n      \"DELETE\",\n      \"PUT\"\n    ],\n    \"access-control-allow-origin\": \"*\",\n    \"cache-control\": \"must-revalidate,no-cache,no-store\",\n    \"connection\": \"keep-alive\",\n    \"content-length\": \"309\",\n    \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\",\n    \"date\": [\n      \"Wed\",\n      \"26 Feb 2025 14:02:35 GMT\"\n    ],\n    \"server\": \"Jetty(9.2.9.v20150224)\"\n  },\n  \"text\": \"<html>\\n<head>\\n<meta http-equiv=\\\"Content-Type\\\" content=\\\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\\\"/>\\n<title>Error 404 Not Found</title>\\n</head>\\n<body><h2>HTTP ERROR 404</h2>\\n<p>Problem accessing /api/v3/store/invenxxxtory.

By implementing\nuiDirectories\nas a single property, IAP can serve static files required for the user interface (UI) in each directory at the path of the file and only in those directories. Moreover, static files can be managed and served more efficiently with all appropriate security headers in place. While directory traversal poses low security risk, this change further reduces that risk, but permits customers who require access to UI-related files to continue serving them in a controlled manner.\nItem\nDescription\nDeprecation Release\nScheduled Removal Release\nReplacement\nstaticFiles\nFiles that store and serve static content (e.g. images, JavaScript, JSON, CSS, HTML, etc).\n2031.1\n2024.1\nuiDirectories\nProperty\n\"uiDirectories\": [\"build\", \"img\"]\nWhat Should I Do?\nFor custom applications, developers need to manually add the\nuiDirectories\nproperty. If the property is not added to the pronghorn.json prior to the end of the deprecation cycle, the UI will not be served (i.e., function). The config sample below illustrates how to add this property.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/workflow-best-practices", "title": "Workflow Best Practices", "text": "Workflow Best Practices\nUpdated on\nApr 1, 2025\nPublished on Jul 31, 2023\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nÔÅö\nThe\nBest Practices\ndescribed below use the new workflow canvas in the\n2023.1\nrelease. However, the same concepts apply for the legacy canvas in earlier release versions. The main difference is the initial workflow orientation. While workflows in either canvas can be positioned in any direction, the new canvas defaults to a top-to-bottom design, whereas the legacy canvas defaults to a left-to-right design.\nThese best practices are provided as suggested approaches to support optimal results within the Itential Platform and to establish basic workflow design standards that may be suitable for widespread adoption. There could be instances where these suggested practices require adaptive modification to support what actually happens in a production environment.\nTop to Bottom Design\nBeing able to quickly and accurately read a workflow is critical. To help with this the flow should be top-to-bottom, then right-to-left. This is referred to as\nTop-to-Bottom\ndesign. Even when the logic requires having divergent paths, keep them flowing from top-to-bottom.\nWhen you need to divert the path based on an evaluation, or if you need to revert to a previous task, the flow should be from right-to-left. When handling an error or failure condition, flow should be left-to-right.\nFigure 1: Top to Bottom Flow\nError and Failure Paths\nUse\nError and Failure\npaths whenever possible. If a workflow encounters a critical error, have all errors exit the same way.\nError pathways should go to the right. Avoid having them run through the center of the workflow whenever possible.\nWhen creating success, failure, and error transitions, try to avoid crossing them whenever possible. This will help to keep your workflows clear and easy to read.\nYou also want to avoid having task transitions go through other tasks. You can use stub tasks to complete this and keep your workflow clean and easy to read. When creating these transitions, do not forget to set the summary and description to something that is easy to understand like ‚ÄúExit Gracefully‚Äù.\nFigure 2: Error and Failure Paths\nError Transitions\nMake sure to always have error transitions. Essentially, allow for failures, even when you do not expect something to fail.  There are times when the system will crash or reset and it may have nothing to do with your workflow, but that can cause less than graceful failures in workflows that do not allow for failure paths in their design.\nSome tasks, such as\nnewVariable\n, do not need error transitions as they process very quickly. Focus on having an error transition from every automated task (those with a green hexagon) when possible.\nDescriptive Summaries\nAlways use descriptive summaries and descriptions on every task. Think of them like comments in your code. The default description that is pre-established for tasks is not very clear. However, the description\n‚ÄúQuery data using a dot/bracket notation string and a matching key/value pair‚Äù\nwhen debugging a workflow is more informative than seeing\n\"Query Workflow Names\"\n. When hovering over a task in Automation Studio, the description is displayed.\nFigure 3: Summary\nProper task names are important as well. When an operator is viewing the details of a job, the task names are listed. These should be summaries that clearly define what is being done without being overly verbose.\nSetting the Job Description\nIf a job refers to an external system ‚Äì such as a trouble ticket system ‚Äì and you can ID the external system, then enhance the job description to include the additional information. This can be done using the\nupdateJobDescription\ntask. This allows operators to more easily search for the job associated with a particular ticket number in\nJobs\n(\nOperations Manager\n), thereby helping to reduce the time it takes to find that correlation compared to if they only had the ticket number.\nÔÅö\nFor more information on\nJobs in Operations Manager\n, use the links referenced below.\nRelease Version\nRelease Version\nRelease Version\n2023.1\n2022.1\n2021.2\nJob descriptions can also be used to mark the status of a job. If the job has an unrecoverable error, for example, you can use the job description to mark exactly what failed, allowing operators to easily search to see how many jobs encountered that error.\nFigure 4: Error or Failure Paths\nWhen naming a workflow, do not use special characters and keep the naming in a format that groups related workflows together.\nWorkflow Nomenclature\nWhen naming workflows, make sure they include a clear description of what processes the workflows are associated with. This allows developers to quickly search for all workflows associated with a process or activity. Creating groups to contain closely associated workflows is another way to manage a collection of similar workflows.\nFigure 5:  Workflow Groups\nThe workflow name can also be abbreviated so it does not take up the entire search window. In the example below (Figure 6), all that is visible is\n‚ÄúDNS Management Infob‚Äù\n. If the developer of this workflow started the name with\n‚ÄúDNS Mgmt‚Äù\nthen users could see easily which workflow was\n‚ÄúDNS Mgmt Infoblox Fixed Address Records Modify‚Äù\ninstead of having to click on each workflow to find the right one.\nFigure 6: Workflow Name\nThe example below (Figure 7) shows proper use of nomenclature. You know what each of these workflows are associated with, and you can easily determine which of the four workflows is listed by running a search for the word ‚ÄòEmail'.\nFigure 7: Abbreviating Names\nJSON Transformations (JSTs)\nUse JSTs when possible. JSON Transformations are incredibly powerful and allow for developers to modify data into new formats. JSON Transformations also provide functionality that is not built into Workflow Builder, such as incrementing a running tally. Utilizing JSTs can also drastically reduce the canvas size of a workflow.\nChild Workflow\nUtilize child workflows when possible, as this will increase reusability. Think of child workflows as a function that will process data and then return the result. Child workflows can be utilized to run identical steps multiple times, or to lower the footprint of a massive workflow into multiple, more manageable, workflows.\nSmaller Workflows\nProcessing of child workflows has improved significantly in Itential Platform, and child workflows are now encouraged. Instead of a monolithic workflow, multiple smaller workflows allow for easier handling and debugging.\nLooping Large Arrays\nAvoid using\nforEach\nloops when iterating over long running or large arrays. If you must process an array with thousands of elements, utilize a JST or child job looping for this purpose.\nPassing Large Objects\nAvoid using large objects thousands of lines long.  If you pass a large object, consider breaking it down into smaller components that are more manageable.\nDangling Tasks\nAvoid dangling tasks when possible. Tasks that do not transition back to the main pathway will fire, but will not return any data back to the main pathway. A better practice would be to return an object showing the status of the tasks (success, failure, warning, etc).\nDangling tasks do not include\nforEach\nloops or tasks that revert to previous tasks. Instead, use a child workflow to accomplish the same goal.\nReuse Workflows\nWhen building workflows, try to design them so they can be used again or more than once in multiple workflows. To help facilitate this, keep workflows small and manageable.\nStandardize your Outputs\nHave your returned values from the workflow be the same across your entire solution. The example below shows the values of\n\"status\"\nand\n\"results\"\nreturned from the child workflow as a job variable. This allows for the parent workflow to quickly check the value of\n\"status\"\nto determine the status of the child workflow. If the values are returned, then they can be accessed by querying the value for the\n\"results\"\nkey.\nFigure 8: Standardized Output\nDefining Job Variables\nDefine job variables at the start of a workflow. This makes it easier to find where a variable needs to be changed. It is significantly easier to change a value here than to find a hard coded value in an\neval\ntask.\nThe start of a workflow is a place to put workflow constants such as Maximum Number of Retries (\nmaxNumberOfRetries\n), Number of Decimal Places, Verbose or Silent. When defining these variables, multi-thread them so they all fire at once. This will increase the overall speed of the workflow.\nFigure 9: Define Variables\nJob variables can be set or defined in\nnewJobVar\ntasks.  They can also be set in the output tab of a task.  Using\nnewJobVar\ntasks make a workflow more readable without having to open the tasks. The\nOutput Tab\njob variable setting is cleaner on the canvas but can be more difficult to track down (users will need to view a workflow JSON export to find everywhere the job variable is used/set).\nVariables to Indicate Workflow Status\nUse\nJob Variables\nas key indicators of workflow success. This helps when looking at the workflow \"variables\" object to understand where the success or failure occurred.\nVariable Mutation\nAvoid\nJob Variable\nmutation when possible. Keep variables clean and consistent, and declare a new name if possible when updating values. This becomes even more important if incrementing a tally or updating workflow status is not possible.\nMisunderstood Features\nThis sections covers task features often incorrectly interpreted or misunderstood.\nQuery\nWorkflow Engine Query Object - Pass on Null\nIf\nPassOnNull\nis set as\nTRUE\nand the query key does not exist, the task will return the entire object that was passed in.\nIf\nPassOnNull\nis set as\nFALSE\nand the query key does not exist, you must use the\nfailure\ntransition to handle the missing key.\nFailure Tasks\nFailure transitions are only utilized in specific areas. This would include a human decision, such as from a\nView Data\ntask, or rejecting a command template. Automatic decisions also use failure transitions, such as from an\neval\ntask. In other cases, error transitions are used.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Workflow Best Practices"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Top to Bottom Design"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Error and Failure Paths"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Error Transitions"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Descriptive Summaries"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Setting the Job Description"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Workflow Nomenclature"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "JSON Transformations (JSTs)"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Child Workflow"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Smaller Workflows"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Looping Large Arrays"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Passing Large Objects"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Dangling Tasks"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Reuse Workflows"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Standardize your Outputs"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Defining Job Variables"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Variables to Indicate Workflow Status"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Variable Mutation"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Misunderstood Features"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Query"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Failure Tasks"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/querying-form-data-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/iag-release-versions", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/jobs-2023-1", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/jobs-2022-1", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/jobs"]}

Users must login to Itential Platform with their credentials. OIDC support in Itential Platform integrations is designed for authenticating/authorizing users with a given OAuth provider for access tokens to the relevant service.\nOIDC Discovery\nAfter creating an Integration instance, Itential Platform reaches out to the discovery endpoint (the\nopenIdConnectUrl\n) and auto-populates the instance with those values. Any of these retrieved values may be overridden after instance creation; however, Itential recommends that you keep most of these values the same.

This guide explains how to set indexes and expose your data collections with search objects.\nOnly use this guide to modify custom applications. Do not modify or update the Pronghorn (Itential) applications.\nExposing an Application for Searching\nA database collection may be searched if the collection is exposed with a search object. This search object is added to the\npronghorn.json\nfile and consists of an object, or an array of objects, that follow the schema below.\nSearch Object Attributes\nAttribute\nDescription\nLabel\nThe name of the application that is used when displaying search results. For example: \"Mop Template\" or \"Workflow\".\nCollection\nThe name of the collection to search.\nFields\nAn array of objects containing fields to search.\nName\n: The field name to search.\nType\n: The type of data. Only type \"string\" is supported.\nMap\nAn object that will format the returned data in a specific way.\nName\n: A field name reference. For example, if the title field is exposed to being searched, set the value to \"title\" to return the title value as the name for each result.\nDescription\n:  A field name reference. Can be null, as many database results will not have a description.\nURL\n: The absolute path used for users to access the content they have found. Uses a mustache template system; therefore, field values are available as variables using the mustache syntax {{variable}}. In addition to your exposed field values, you also have access to the\nmongo_id\nfield .\nExamples\nUse the following examples to set the search template and search exposure object.\nEmpty Search Template\n// Place this in pronghorn.json.\n    \"search\": {\n      \"label\": \"YOUR APP NAME\",\n      \"collection\": \"DATABASE COLLECTION NAME\",\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"FIELD TITLE\",\n          \"type\": \"FIELD TYPE (only \"string\" supported currently)\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"map\": {\n        \"name\": \"FIELD REFERENCE NAME\",\n        \"description\": \"FIELD REFERENCE NAME (can be null or empty)\",\n        \"url\": \"/myapp/{{EXAMPLE_VAR}}?myvar={{EXAMPLE_VAR}}\"\n      }\n    },\nSearch Exposure Object\n\"search\": {\n      \"label\": \"Mop\",\n      \"collection\": \"mop_templates\",\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"name\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"map\": {\n        \"name\": \"name\",\n        \"description\": null,\n        \"url\": \"/mop/template?name={{name}}\"\n      }\n    },\nText Only\n- Currently, you can only search on text-based fields (\n\"type\": \"string\"\n). Other types may be supported in the future.\nCreate Index for Exposed Collections\nYou will need to create the proper indexes for your fields to be search enabled. For MongoDB, simple compound indexes are used. You list each field name followed by the number\n1\nas the field value. For more detailed information on creating indexes, refer to:\nMongoDB Method Reference\ndb.collection.createIndex()\n.\nIndex Must Match Fields\n- The compound index must match the fields in the search template. For example, if you want to search on name and type, you must have a compound index on\nname and type.\nTo create an index against a local instance for testing:\nRun the following command in a MongoDB collection browser. This example creates an index on the MOP templates collection for\nname\n. This index will persist to the local database, but if it is dropped it will need to be recreated.\ndb.getCollection('mop_templates').createIndex({ \"name\": 1 }, { background: true });\nNote:\nBe careful when setting indexes and exposing items to search. If done incorrectly, it can have a profound negative impact. To avoid potential issues, adhere to the following guidelines.\nBe careful not to create too many indexes!

Navigate to\nItential Platform\n‚Üí\nAdmin Essentials\n‚Üí\nProfile\n. For more information, see\nProfiles\n.\nCommon Log Format\nThe log format for the\nWeb Server Access Log\nis a stringified JSON object with each key mapping to a part of the Common Log Format. Since this is a JSON format, the ordering of the keys is not guaranteed. The keys, in the order they appear, in a traditional Common Log Format are referenced below.\nKey\nDescription\nremote_addr\nThe IP address where the request comes from.\nremote_user\nThe username within Itential Platform that made the request. If the user is not authenticated, a value of\nanon\nwill be used instead.\ndate\nThe date the request was made in the Common Log Format.\nmethod\nThe HTTP method of the request (GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE).\nurl\nThe url path used by the request.\nhttp_version\nThe HTTP version used to make the request.\nstatus\nThe status code returned as a response.\nresult_length\nThe size of the response data in bytes. If this cannot be parsed, a value of \"-\" will be used instead.\nConfiguration\nThe\nWeb Server Access Log\ncurrently has two different configurable properties that can be edited within the Itential Platform profile by updating\nloggerProps\nin the\nProfile Properties\n. Both properties can be found in the\nwebserver\nsection of the\nConfigure\ntab. Example input is shown in the figure below.\nProperty\nDescription\nlog_directory\nThe file path to the directory where the access logfile will be stored.\nlog_filename\nThe exact name for the web server access logfile that will be created and used to store all access logs. It will be located within the log_directory specified.\nFigure 1: Profile Properties\nLog Rotation\nThere is no automatic log rotation built into the\nWeb Server Access Log\nwhich means that configuring an external log rotator is very important. One very useful tool to accomplish this is\nlogrotate\n, a Linux tool that can automatically rotate a log file based on configured parameters. It can be installed simply by using your package manager and running:\nRHEL/CentOS\nyum install logrotate\nVerify that\nlogrotate\nis installed, and then check the configuration file, which for this example will be at\n/etc/logrotate.conf\n. There may be other ways to handle configuration such as inside the\n/etc/logrotate.d/\nfolder. The following is an example configuration where the webserver logfile is named\nwebserver.log\nand is located at\n/var/log/pronghorn\n.\n/var/log/pronghorn/webserver.log {\n  rotate 10\n  size 10M\n  nocompress\n}\nIn the above example, the logs will be rotated a maximum of 10 times before the old log files will be deleted. It will only rotate the logs when their size exceeds 10 megabytes, as specified by\n10M\nin the configuration file. Finally, it will not compress files when it rotates them, as defined by\nnocompress\n, which it would otherwise do automaticallly if not specified.\nBelow is another possible configuration file:\n/var/log/pronghorn/webserver.log {\n  weekly\n  rotate 20\n  postrotate\n      echo Hello World\n  endscript\n}\nIn this example, the logs will rotate weekly instead of rotating based on any fixed size. It will also rotate a maximum of 20 times. Finally, there is a postrotate script included, which means that in this case, any time the logs are rotated it will echo\nHello World\nto the console. It may be useful to configure a custom script to run whenever logs rotate.\nRunning this command will start the log rotation:\nlogrotate /etc/logrotate.conf\nIf you wish to force a rotation immediately, even when the various initiators of a rotation such as file size have not been met, run this command:\nlogrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf\nQuerying Log Files\nThe log files can be queried using basic command line tools such as\ngrep\nto search the file for a given pattern.\nUsing GREP or Similar Command Line Tools\nIf a user wanted to find any API requests made by a user named\nadmin\nfor the log file named\nwebserver.log\n, they could use the following command:\ngrep '\"remote_user\":\"admin\"' webserver.log\nIn order to retrieve all the times a user has made a request to a specific route, such as\nGET /health/system\nfor example, they could use the following command:\ngrep -E '\"url\":\"/health/system\"' webserver.log | grep '\"verb\":\"GET\"'\nThere are many other ways\ngrep\nand similar command line tools can be used to query information from the JSON logs. Since all data values are preceded by a key, such as\nurl\nor\nremote_user\n, it is possible to do standard queries on any value.\nUsing Third-Party Visualization Tools\nThe log format used by the access log should work with various third-party tools which support a standard JSON log format. These can be used for more advanced queries or visualization of logging information.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Web Server Access Log"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Common Log Format"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Configuration"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Log Rotation"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Querying Log Files"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Using GREP or Similar Command Line Tools"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Using Third-Party Visualization Tools"}], "code_blocks": ["yum install logrotate", "yum install logrotate", "/var/log/pronghorn/webserver.log {\n  rotate 10\n  size 10M\n  nocompress\n}", "/var/log/pronghorn/webserver.log {\n  rotate 10\n  size 10M\n  nocompress\n}", "/var/log/pronghorn/webserver.log {\n  weekly\n  rotate 20\n  postrotate\n      echo Hello World\n  endscript\n}", "/var/log/pronghorn/webserver.log {\n  weekly\n  rotate 20\n  postrotate\n      echo Hello World\n  endscript\n}", "logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf", "logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf", "logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf", "logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf", "grep '\"remote_user\":\"admin\"' webserver.log", "grep '\"remote_user\":\"admin\"' webserver.log", "grep -E '\"url\":\"/health/system\"' webserver.log | grep '\"verb\":\"GET\"'", "grep -E '\"url\":\"/health/system\"' webserver.log | grep '\"verb\":\"GET\"'"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/user-cannot-see-applications-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-resources-best-practices", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/profiles-iap"]}

Please see the section below for more detail.\nIAG to End Practice of Ansible Module Certification\nWith the 2023.1 release of Itential Automation Gateway, Itential will end the practice of performing manual certification of Ansible modules and collections.\nItential introduced this practice in IAG release 2018.3 to address issues with the quality of the Ansible community modules used by many of our customers. In several cases, the community-produced modules and collections lacked sufficient or accurate documentation, such as variables declared in documentation that did not match the types expected in the modules themselves. These mismatches were corrected by Itential as part of the Ansible Module Certification.\nIn recent years, the content quality for community-produced modules and collections has reached sufficient levels that Itential‚Äôs practice of certification is no longer required.\nWhat does this mean for customers?\nThis change will have little to no impact for Itential customers executing automations. Itential is still committed to verifying that Itential Automation Gateway leverages the capabilities of the Ansible core libraries to ensure correct integration with Ansible. As of Ansible Core version 2.12, all community-produced modules and collections have been removed from the Ansible Core packages and maintained in a separate Ansible Community space.\nÔÅö\nPlease refer to the official Ansible documentation for\nCollections in the Community Namespace / Community.General\n.\nCustomers who configured the Itential Automation Gateway adapter to show only certified modules and playbooks must turn this flag off if they wish to use Ansible playbooks, modules, and collections from Ansible Core 2.12+ and Ansible Community 5+ in Automation Studio. Customers using modules certified for Ansible Core 2.9 and Ansible Core 2.10 can continue to apply the certification filtering flag.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "IAG 2023.1"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "IAG Feature Release Notes [2023.1.0]"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "IAG to End Practice of Ansible Module Certification"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "What does this mean for customers?"}], "code_blocks": [], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/iag-20232-feature-release", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/iag-20221-feature-release"]}

The\nauthorizationUrl\nis the URL the user will be sent to in order to authorize the grant (i.e., retrieve the auth code). That URL will then redirect the user back to Itential Platform with an authorization code, which Itential Platform will automatically exchange at the\ntokenUrl\nfor an access token.\nThe\nscopes\nis an enumerated list of\nscope_name: description\nof all scopes the OAuth provider offers, from which the user may choose a subset for the access token. From\nAdmin Essentials\n, the user can declare this subset in the configuration of the integration instance.\nHow to Set Up the Integration Instance\nThe framework of an integration instance is shown in Figure 1. To configure, you need to give the integration the\nclient_id\nand\nclient_secret\nfrom your OAuth2 provider.\nMake sure you supply the OAuth provider with the\nredirect_uri\nof\n{{iap}}/admin/oauth/\n. For example, if Itential Platform is at\nhttps://itential.iap.com/\n, then you need to set the\nredirect_uri\nas\nhttps://itential.iap.com/admin/oauth/\n(Reminder: Do not forget the trailing\n/\n).\nOptionally, specify your desired scopes of the access token in the\nscope\nas a space-separated string. Using the\nschema model\nabove, a valid\nscope\nsetting could be\nmanage_app_users\n,\nmanage_data_retention\nand\nmanage_webhook\n.\nOnce you have configured your integration instance, click\nSave\nto retain your changes.\nFigure 1: Integration Auth Code Flow\nHow to Retrieve an Access Token\nTo obtain an access token, click the\nGet Access Token\nbutton (Figure 2) which sends you to the OAuth2 provider you are interfacing with to \"Approve Access\". Remember, you must supply the OAuth2 provider with the redirect URL of\n{{iap}}/admin/oauth/\n. The example in\nFigure 3\nuses the\nBoxDev OAuth2\nprovider, but this works for any OAuth2 provider.\nFigure 2: Get Access Token\nFigure 3: OAuth2 Provider Confirmation\nOnce access is granted, you are redirected back to Itential Platform and a success notification will display (Figure 4) to confirm the access token was retrieved.\nFigure 4: Retrieved Access Token\nTroubleshooting Common Errors\nIf you fail to retrieve the access token, there are a few likely reasons:\nInvalid\nclient_id\nor\nclient_secret\n. Double-check with your OAuth provider that these values are correct.\nInvalid\nscope\n. If you attempt to request a scope that does not exist, the OAuth provider may outright refuse your request.\nInvalid\ntoken_url\n. You may change the\ntoken_url\nfor a given instance after creation.

The\neventSystem\nallows a service to publish information to the Itential Platform environment that other services can react to.\nThe event system has three main methods (which are described in this guide):\neventSystem.publish(topic, payload);\n\neventSystem.subscribe(source, topic, handler);\n\neventSystem.unsubscribe(source, topic, handler);\nEvent Definition\nTo define an event that you want your service to publish, add a\ntopics\nsection to the pronghorn.json of your application. For example:\n\"topics\" : {\n    \"launch\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"required\": [\"rocket\"],\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"rocket\": {}\n        }\n    },\n    \"bananas\": {}\n}\nThe above example defines two topics that can be emitted as events by the Itential application,\nlaunch\nand\nbananas\n. The\nlaunch\nobject contains a JSON schema that defines what its event payload should look like. As you can see the property\nrocket\nis required for the event's payload. If it is not present in the payload the event will not be processed. If an event does not match the defined schema it is rejected.\nThe\nbananas\nevent has no requirement for how its payload should look. You can publish as many events as you like.\n\"topics\" : {\n    \"eventName1\": {\n        -JSON Schema-\n    },\n    \"eventName2\": {\n        -JSON Schema-\n    }\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    \"eventNameN\": {\n        -JSON Schema-\n    }\n}\nNamespace\nThese events are automatically namespaced in the system using the model name of the application (e.g.,\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\n). This allows developers to have events with the same name. Hence, the event name \"rocket\" could be used in both\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\nand\n@itential/app-configuration_manager\n.\nRegistration\nWhen an application connects to Itential Platform it automatically sends all of its defined event topics. Itential Platform adds the event topics to the global list it maintains and then broadcasts the updated global list to all other applications. This allows the other applications to subscribe to the new events.\n‚ìò Note:\nCurrently there is no verification of event payload within Itential Platform. This is handled by the\neventSystem\nin the application when it receives an event it is subscribed to.\nSubscription\nTo handle a particular event, call the\neventSystem.subscribe\nmethod. After an event is subscribed to, the event system will call the handler function when it receives the event and verify the payload matches the schema.\neventSystem.subscribe(source, topic, handler)\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\nsource\nstring\nThe application publishing the event. For example:\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\ntopic\nstring\nThe name of the event topic you care about. For example:\nlaunch\nhandler\nfunction\nA handler function that processes the payload data of the event.\nExample\neventSystem.subscribe(\"@itential/app-workflow_engine\", \"launch\", launchHandler);\nUnsubscribing\nTo stop listening for an event, call the\neventSystem.unsubscribe\nmethod. This will cause the event system to stop calling the handler function for a particular event. Unsubscribing tells the event system you no longer care about that event topic.\neventSystem.unsubscribe(source, topic, handler)\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\nsource\nstring\nThe application publishing the event. For example:\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\ntopic\nstring\nThe name of the event topic you no longer care about.

This will send the event to Itential Platform for broadcast to all the other applications in the Itential Platform environment. Notice there is no source when publishing. The namespace is automatically added by the event system to ensure proper scope.\neventSystem.publish(topic, payload)\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\ntopic\nstring\nThe name of the event you are sending.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/event-service-configuration-itential-platform", "title": "Event Service Configuration", "text": "Event Service Configuration\nUpdated on\nJan 28, 2025\nPublished on Nov 21, 2024\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nEvent Listening\nThe event deduplication feature is designed to handle situations where the same event might occur from multiple sources, especially in the context of highly-available architecture. If multiple downstream resources can report the same event, or if multiple Itential Platform instances are listening to events from the same downstream resource, multiple event messages may be broadcast in the Itential Platform event system for the same downstream occurrence. In this case, actions listening for those events will execute multiple times. In most cases, however, the desired behavior is to respond only once for each distinct occurrence.\nFor example, event deduplication may be required if an instance of NSO is observed by a cluster of Itential Platform servers. In this scenario, each Itential Platform server will maintain its own individual connection to the NSO server. NETCONF events produced by the NSO server will be observed by all running instances of Itential Platform, resulting in multiple messages being generated in the Itential Platform event system for a single NETCONF event. In this case, Itential Platform event deduplication may be configured to ensure that only one message is emitted to the event bus so that there is only one response to the event from the system as a whole.\nConfiguring Event Deduplication\nIn the active Itential Platform profile, you will need to set the service config of each event producer which requires event deduplication. Once the active profile is configured to enable event deduplication, each service for which events are to be deduplicated must then be configured.\nThe most important settings shown below are\nactive\nand\nuniqueProps\n, which determine the on/off status of the feature, as well as the set of message properties that will be used to determine which messages are duplicates. The\nuniqueProps\nallow you to handpick the fields that will be used to evaluate if two events are to be regarded as duplicates. For example, if the values of the three fields specified below (\n\"/value/device\"\n,\n\"/value/event\"\n,\n\"/value/timestamp\"\n) are the same between two events, the event is considered as a duplicate. If any of these are different, then the events are not deduplicated.\nBelow is a sample service config for\neventDeduplication\nsettings.\n{\n  ...,\n  \"properties\" : { ... },\n  \"eventDeduplication\": {\n    \"active\" : true,\n    \"cacheTtl\" : 100,\n    \"algorithm\" : \"md5\",\n    \"uniqueProps\" : [\n      \"/value/device\",\n      \"/value/event\",\n      \"/value/timestamp\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\neventDeduplication\nUse this reference table to help set\neventDeduplication\nproperties for the service config.\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\nactive\nBoolean\nFalse\nTurns event deduplication on or off at the component level.\ncacheTtl\nInteger\n100\nOverrides the global message identifier time-to-live setting for this service.\nalgorithm\nString\nsha512\nAlgorithm used to hash event messages when producing a message identifier. See below for more info.\nuniqueProps\nEnum\n(\"array\",\n\"object\",\nnull)\nNull\n(Use all properties.)\nDenotes which message fields will be used when producing a message identifier. This setting may be used to exclude fields which may vary slightly between event producers or do not pertain to the uniqueness of the message. See below for more detail.\nalgorithm\nThe\nalgorithm\nsetting is unlikely to be required, but in the case that it is, available options are discoverable via\nopenssl list -digest-algorithms\n, or\nopenssl list-message-digest-algorithms\non older systems. The library used to create a message digest uses the system's openssl utility to produce a result.\nuniqueProps\nThe\nuniqueProps\nsetting is used to tell the deduplication system which fields define a unique message. The fields specified in this property are used to extract a subset of the message which is then hashed to provide a unique value to the deduplication system.\nFor example, if the\nuniqueProps\nproperty specifies the fields\ndevice\n,\nevent\nand\ntimestamp\n, the following messages will be considered as redundant to each other, and two of them will be dropped while the first is emitted through the event system.\n{\n  \"device\": \"ios1\",\n  \"event\": \"CRASH\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1592329817,\n  \"remediation\": \"REBOOT\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"device\": \"ios1\",\n  \"event\": \"CRASH\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1592329817,\n}\n\n{\n  \"device\": \"ios1\",\n  \"event\": \"CRASH\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1592329817,\n  \"region\": \"us-east-1\"\n}\nWhen using inclusive configuration (shown below as JSON Pointer Array and Inclusive Mask Object), it is mandatory that\nuniqueProps\nbe specified explicitly. In the event that none of the specified fields are found in a message, it is considered unique and subsequent messages like it will not be deduplicated.\nJSON Pointer Array\nWhen\nuniqueProps\nis an array, it must contain a list of\nJSON pointer\nexpressions. These expressions tell Itential Platform which properties should be used when comparing messages, forming an inclusive list.\n[\n  \"/value/device\",\n  \"/value/event\",\n  \"/value/timestamp\"\n]\nInclusive Mask Object\nThe\nuniqueProps\nsetting may also be specified as an object with\ntrue\nor\nfalse\nas its leaf values (example below). In this form,\nuniqueProps\nacts as a 'mask' object. Keep in mind,\ntrue\nand\nfalse\nleaf values may not be mixed, as this causes ambiguity in the mask object in some situations.\nThe example below is equivalent to the JSON Pointer Array example above.\n{\n  \"value\": {\n    \"device\": true,\n    \"event\": true,\n    \"timestamp\": true\n  }\n}\nThe inverse of the above is also possible for use in case the messages from an event source are deduplicated based on all but a known set of properties.

A model is loaded into Itential Platform using an OpenAPI specification. Itential Platform supports the OpenAPI 3 specification.\nThis page walks you through the steps for creating and using Integration Models for Integrations in Admin Essentials. Current limitations with regard to creating an Integration Model are covered also. Please note that available views, features, and interactions in the Platform interface can be limited based on user permissions.\nSee related page\n‚ûü\nIntegrations\nSwagger & OpenAPI Support\nSwagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0 are currently supported for creating an Integration Model. A Swagger 2.0 document is converted to an OpenAPI 3 document on import. All OpenAPI 3.0 documents must conform to the\nOpenAPI v3.0 Specification\n.\nImporting an Integration Model\nTo create an Integration Model:\nLogin to the Platform and navigate to\nAdmin Essentials\n.\nClick the\nImport\nicon in the top toolbar to display the\nImport\ndialog.\nSelect\nIntegration Model\nfrom the dropdown. The\nImport\nmodal will display.\nUpload a\nSwagger or OpenAPI File\nby drag-and-drop, or use the\nClick to Browse\nlink to find and select the file you want to upload.\nOnce the file is uploaded, the\nName\nof the\nIntegration Model\nwill pre-populate from the specification file, along with a description. You can change the description, as needed, to provide specific information for your import and to better communicate what this integration is used for within your platform.\nFigure 1: Import Integration Model File\nValidating an Imported Integration Model\nWhen you upload a Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0 specification file, you can run validation on it using the\nValidate\n(‚úì) button. The OpenAPI specification file must be obtained from the targeted integration. For example,\ngitlab\n,\namazon\n, and\njenkins\nprovide OpenAPI specifications that properly describe their APIs.\nAdmin Essentials\ncan ingest these files and enable integration with these technologies within IAP.\nFigure 2: Import Specification File\nOnce you click the\nImport\nbutton, and upon successful import, the\nIntegration Model\nwill be added to the collection list in the left sidebar.\nWhen you select the\nIntegration Model\nfrom the collection list you will be redirected to the\nIntegration Model Details\npage.\nFigure 3: Integration Model Details\nKnown Limitations\nDescribed below are known limitations with regard to creating an Integration Model, along with the steps involved in editing after the Integration Model has been imported.\nServers\nCurrently a single server endpoint is supported for Integrations. If the OpenAPI document has more than one server listed in its\nservers\nobject, the first server will be selected for use. This endpoint can be updated in the service configuration after the Integration is created.\nExample Template for Single Server Endpoint\nAny server URL using the OpenAPI path template expressions will have the default value for variables applied. Below is an example of a configuration using multiple servers and URLs using path template expressions.\n\"servers\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"The s3 multi-region endpoint\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.{region}.amazonaws.com\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"default\": \"us-east-2\",\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\n            \"us-east-1\",\n            \"us-east-2\",\n            \"us-west-1\",\n            \"us-west-2\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"The s3 multi-region endpoint\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.{region}.amazonaws.com\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"default\": \"us-east-1\",\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\n            \"us-east-1\",\n            \"us-east-2\",\n            \"us-west-1\",\n            \"us-west-2\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n]\nThe resulting URL used in the service configuration will be the following:\nhttps://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/\nThis URL result was determined by taking the first server listed in the array and applying the default variable values to the template URL. Again, this URL can be edited in the service configuration after the Integration is created.\nUpdating Integration Models\nIt is currently impossible to edit an integration model after it has been imported into Itential Platform. Instead, the integration model must be deleted and replaced. To do this:\nDelete all integrations associated with the model.\nDelete the integration model.\nImport an updated version of the integration model.\nRecreate all integrations associated with the model.\nRecreate any workflow tasks that reference prior integration versions, ensuring that each now references an updated version instead. This must be done on a per-workflow, task-by-task basis.\nIntegration Models With Dynamic API Key Retrieval\nThe OpenAPI specification used by Itential Platform now supports specification extensions via\nx-itential-parameters\n. Specifically for this feature, Integration Models with an\napiKey\nsecurity schema now support dynamic retrieval via the custom extension\nx-itential-dynamic-retrieval\n.\nRelated Reading:\nOpenAPI Extensions\nSpecification Extensions\nAn example integration model with the\nx-itential-dynamic retrieval\nextension is presented below.\nNotice that\nx-itential-parameters\nare defined in the\nsecuritySchemes\nobject, and the specific request the parameter is used in is defined by\n\"x-itential-use-in\": [\"key\"]\n.\n{\n  ...\n  \"components\": {\n    \"securitySchemes\": {\n      \"apiKeySchemeName\": {\n        \"type\": \"apiKey\",\n        \"in\": \"header\",\n        \"name\": \"my_auth\",\n        \"x-itential-dynamic-retrieval\": {\n          \"method\": \"POST\",\n          \"url\": \"https://some.api.com/api/v2/key\",\n          \"responsePointer\": \"/credentials/key\"\n        },\n        \"x-itential-parameters\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"password\",\n            \"in\": \"query\",\n            \"x-itential-use-in\": [\n              \"key\"\n            ],\n            \"schema\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nIn this example, the\nx-itential-dynamic-retrieval\nextension allows an integration instance to obtain an\napiKey\nby issuing an HTTP call, performing a CRUD operation (specified by\nmethod\n) to a\nurl\n, and then querying the response via JSON Pointer.\nThe expected reponse from calling\nPOST\nto\nhttps://some.api.com/api/v2/key\nyields an object that looks like this:\n{\n  \"credentials\": {\n    \"key\": \"the api key value\"\n  }\n}\nThe\nresponsePointer\nwill query\n/credentials/key\nand return the actual API key to use for authentication.\nWth this feature, the Integration instance will attempt to retrieve a new API key in the following scenarios:\nBefore executing a task if the Integration has no stored API key value.\nAfter receiving an\nHTTP 401\nresponse from an API call. In this scenario, the Integration will automatically retry the call one time (1x) after retrieving a new API key.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Integration Models"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Swagger & OpenAPI Support"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Importing an Integration Model"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Validating an Imported Integration Model"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Known Limitations"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Servers"}, {"level": "h4", "text": "Example Template for Single Server Endpoint"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Updating Integration Models"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Integration Models With Dynamic API Key Retrieval"}], "code_blocks": ["\"servers\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"The s3 multi-region endpoint\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.{region}.amazonaws.com\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"default\": \"us-east-2\",\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\n            \"us-east-1\",\n            \"us-east-2\",\n            \"us-west-1\",\n            \"us-west-2\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"The s3 multi-region endpoint\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.{region}.amazonaws.c", "\"servers\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"The s3 multi-region endpoint\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.{region}.amazonaws.com\",\n      \"variables\": {\n        \"region\": {\n          \"default\": \"us-east-2\",\n          \"description\": \"The AWS region\",\n          \"enum\": [\n            \"us-east-1\",\n            \"us-east-2\",\n            \"us-west-1\",\n            \"us-west-2\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"The s3 multi-region endpoint\",\n      \"url\": \"https://s3.{region}.amazonaws.c", "https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/", "https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/", "x-itential-parameters", "x-itential-dynamic-retrieval", "x-itential-dynamic retrieval", "x-itential-parameters", "\"x-itential-use-in\": [\"key\"]", "{\n  ...\n  \"components\": {\n    \"securitySchemes\": {\n      \"apiKeySchemeName\": {\n        \"type\": \"apiKey\",\n        \"in\": \"header\",\n        \"name\": \"my_auth\",\n        \"x-itential-dynamic-retrieval\": {\n          \"method\": \"POST\",\n          \"url\": \"https://some.api.com/api/v2/key\",\n          \"responsePointer\": \"/credentials/key\"\n        },\n        \"x-itential-parameters\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"password\",\n            \"in\": \"query\",\n            \"x-itential-use-in\": [\n              \"key\"\n  ", "{\n  ...\n  \"components\": {\n    \"securitySchemes\": {\n      \"apiKeySchemeName\": {\n        \"type\": \"apiKey\",\n        \"in\": \"header\",\n        \"name\": \"my_auth\",\n        \"x-itential-dynamic-retrieval\": {\n          \"method\": \"POST\",\n          \"url\": \"https://some.api.com/api/v2/key\",\n          \"responsePointer\": \"/credentials/key\"\n        },\n        \"x-itential-parameters\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"password\",\n            \"in\": \"query\",\n            \"x-itential-use-in\": [\n              \"key\"\n  ", "x-itential-dynamic-retrieval", "https://some.api.com/api/v2/key", "{\n  \"credentials\": {\n    \"key\": \"the api key value\"\n  }\n}", "{\n  \"credentials\": {\n    \"key\": \"the api key value\"\n  }\n}"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-integrations-openid-connect-discovery", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-admin-essentials-repositories", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/itential-platform-admin-essentials-integrations", "https://swagger.io/docs/specification/openapi-extensions/"]}

For users migrating to newer versions of Itential Platform, see related notices:\nPlatform 6\n- Automation Catalog Removed\nPlatform 2023.1\n- Breaking Change: Automation Catalog Read-Only Mode\nTo migrate an existing Automation Catalog automation:\nClick the\nMigrate\noption in the action dropdown menu (Figure 6).\nAfter confirming the migration, you will be redirected to a newly-created\nAutomation Details\npage in Operations Manager.\nFigure 6: Migrate Existing Automation\nFigure 7: Automation Details\nMigrating Automation Triggers\nEach migrated automation will automatically have a manual trigger created. This preserves the existing manual run functionality in Automation Catalog using the play button.\nIf the migrated automation ran on a schedule, a scheduled trigger will also be created with the scheduled options for that migrated automation. Please note, the migrated schedule trigger must be enabled in Operations Manager post-migration. If form data was assigned to the scheduled automation, it will also be added to the newly-created scheduled trigger.\nThe migrated Automation Catalog item will be preserved in Automation Catalog. Make sure to delete the Automation Catalog item or turn off its schedule if no longer needed post-migration.\nFigure 8: Migrated Automation Trigger Cards\nCloning an Automation with API Triggers\nAn important limitation must be recognized when cloning an automation with one or more API triggers; the\nrouteName\nproperty of an API trigger must be unique among enabled triggers. For this reason, Operations Manager will disable all API triggers when cloning an automation, and the user must manually choose new route names for the cloned API triggers in the new automation before they can be re-enabled.\nAutomation Error Handling\nYour automation is continuously evaluated for errors as you work (e.g., references to non-existent access groups; misconfigured triggers; missing documents such as forms, JSON Schema Transformations (JSTs), and workflows). When no such errors are detected, the\nPassed Validation\nicon is displayed near the top-right corner of your automation.\nFigure 9: Validated Automation\nIf your automation does\nnot pass\nvalidation, the\nView Errors\nicon is displayed instead. Clicking this will open the\nErrors Panel\n, a full list of the problems affecting your automation. When appropriate, items in this list contain a hyperlink to the affected component, creating a centralized hub for error remediation.\nFigure 10: Errors Panel\n‚ìò Note:\nAutomation components in an error state will additionally be marked on the UI via the\nError ![icon]\n.\nEnabling Optional Features in Ops Manager\nOptional features can be enabled (or disabled) for Operations Manager (\"Ops Manager\") by setting the appropriate properties via its\nservice configuration\n. This section demonstrates how to use\nAdmin Essentials\nto set those properties and provides a reference list of configurable properties.\nConfiguration Properties\nTo enable or disable optional features in Ops Manager:\nLaunch\nAdmin Essentials\nfrom the Itential Platform dashboard.\nSelect\nOperations Manager\nfrom the\nApplications\nlist displayed on the side navigation menu. The\nConfiguration\ntab displays, showing a checklist of configurable properties (Figure 1).\nEnable or disable a property (feature) by clicking its checkbox.\nIf a blank screen displays, toggle the ‚ÄúAdvanced View‚Äù switch on the right to open the\nService Config\neditor to add the property.\nSave your changes by clicking the\nSave\n(\nÔÉá\n) button located above the\nProperties\nlist.\nFigure 11: Operations Manager Configuration (Tab)\nFigure 12: Operations Manager Service Config Editor (Advanced View Toggle)\nConfigurable Properties\nThe following property features can be enabled or disabled for Operations Manager.\nProperty\nDescription\nmaximizeJobTasksOnLoad\nMaximizes the\nJob Detail\ns panel by default when opening job visualizations (the Job Details view).\nactionableTasksInJobsTable\nAdds an\nActionable Tasks\ncolumn to the Jobs table which lists all of the actionable tasks present in each displayed job. Users may also claim actionable tasks from this column. For performance reasons, enabling this feature limits the maximum number of rows displayed on the Jobs table to 50.\nfinishManualTaskEnableAnyType\nOps Manager service property that enables the\nfinishManualTask\nAPI to finish non-manual tasks.\nService Config Editor\nUsing the toogle switch in the upper-right, properties can also be enabled or disabled via the\nAdvanced\nediting view, which displays the current service configuration in JSON format. For example, to enable the\nmaximizeJobTasksOnLoad\nproperty, you can define it under the\nproperties\nkey as follows:\n\"properties\" : {\n    \"maximizeJobTasksOnLoad\": true\n}\nThe\nmaximizeJobTasksOnLoad\nproperty is a feature flag to help users who are accustomed to seeing all running jobs and automations, including the workflow canvas, as it is being worked. When this feature is enabled, it displays the workflow within the Job Details view. Users can also enlarge the workflow canvas for better visualization.\nFigure 13: Job Details View\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Intro to Ops Manager & Automations"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Operations Manager UI"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Icon Bar"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Automations Collection View"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Action Icons in Automations Collection"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Automation Card Menu Options"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Automation Details in Ops Manager"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Action Icons for Automation Details"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Automation Properties"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Migrating an Automation from Automation Catalog"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Migrating Automation Triggers"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Cloning an Automation with API Triggers"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Automation Error Handling"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Enabling Optional Features in Ops Manager"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Configuration Properties"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Configurable Properties"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Service Config Editor"}], "code_blocks": ["maximizeJobTasksOnLoad", "actionableTasksInJobsTable", "finishManualTaskEnableAnyType", "maximizeJobTasksOnLoad", "\"properties\" : {\n    \"maximizeJobTasksOnLoad\": true\n}", "\"properties\" : {\n    \"maximizeJobTasksOnLoad\": true\n}", "maximizeJobTasksOnLoad"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/operations-manager-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/jobs-operations-manager-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-automations-itential-platform#icon-bar", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-automations-itential-platform#automation-details", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-automations-itential-platform#automations-collection-view", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-automations-itential-platform#operations-manager-ui", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-automations-itential-platform#action-icons-collection-view", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-automations-itential-platform#automation-card-menu-options", "https://docs.itential.com/v1/docs/automations-4#automation-details", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-automations-itential-platform#automation-error-handling", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-automations-itential-platform#action-icons-for-automation-details", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-automations-itential-platform#automation-properties", "https://docs.itential.com/v1/docs/triggers-ops-manager-iap", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/automation-catalog-deprecated-and-removed", "https://docs.itential.com/v1/docs/breaking-change-automation-catalog-2023-1", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/ops-manager-automations-itential-platform#automation-details", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/applications-admin-essentials-iap"]}

For example, the SANS Institute recommends administrators update passwords at least every 90 days. While updating adapters and integrations passwords in Itential Platform is relatively straight forward, doing so to the adapter responsible for AAA (LDAP/Radius/Azure) can lead to a downtime incident if not performed in the correct order. Itential Platform Administrators should review the following steps before conducting a password rotation procedure ‚Äì especially for the adapter responsible for AAA.\nFigure 1: Login Error\nAAA Password Rotation Procedure\nTo rotate AAA Passwords in Itential Platform:\nLogin to Itential Platform at least one (1) hour (default token expiration) prior to your password rotation schedule. This is to ensure you have an active session token within Itential Platform during the password update process. If no active session is present, admins will have to fall back to direct MongoDB and Itential Platform shell access instead of using Admin Essentials views.\nPerform password rotation procedure on the AAA system (Active Directory, Azure, Radius, etc). Starting at this point, new users will not be able to request new log-in sessions (token).\nDepending on your system configuration, update the new password in your password manager (\nHashiCorp Vault\nor\nCyberArk CCP\n) and/or Itential Platform adapter service config (via Admin Essentials view) in exact order.\nIf no adapter service config change was needed (or in cases of HA/DR environments), navigate to the active profile within Admin Essentials and issue a manual adapter restart request to load the new password from your password manager. At this point, users should be able to establish new login sessions.\nRestart the adapter instance on each Itential Platform node in the HA/DR cluster for all nodes to be in sync with the new password.\nVerify login. While still logged into Itential Platform in the existing browser, open a second incognito browser and perform a login to the same Itential Platform instance using standard credentials (i.e., username and password).\nItential Platform is now using the rotated password for its AAA adapter and users are able to successfully create new login sessions.\nUnable to Login to Itential Platform\n‚ö†\nIf for any reason user is unable to login to Itential Platform, or no longer has an active Itential Platform session, direct MongoDB and Itential Platform server shell access are required.\nRefer to the official MongoDB documentation to do a manual document update via\nmongosh\ncommand.\nOnce changes have been implemented in MongoDB, the AAA adapter will have to be bounced on each Itential Platform node in the cluster using either method below:\nIssue the\nsystemctl restart automation-platform\ncommand to restart the entire platform. This method is disruptive, and should be performed on each node of the cluster.\nOr, identify the PID for the running AAA adapter and use\nkill\nto bounce the adapter process.\nFigure 2: Running AAA Adapter PID\nFigure 3: Kill Command\nProceed to the Itential Platform web interface, and login.\nRelated Reading\nMongoDB Shell\nUpdate Documents via MongoDB Shell\nSANS Institute\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "Updating AAA Passwords in Itential Platform"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "AAA Password Rotation Procedure"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Unable to Login to Itential Platform"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Related Reading"}], "code_blocks": ["systemctl restart automation-platform"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/pingid", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/system-integrations-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/v1/docs/hashicorp-vault-encryption-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/v1/docs/cyberark-central-credential-provider-integration", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/", "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/crud/update/"]}

Using the sample external authentication script, Itential Platform will provide the set of groups defined inside Itential Platform and discovered from the configured AAA system to NSO to be applied to the NACM rule-lists.\nNote:\nIt is important that the set of groups returned by the NSO AAA provider properly match NACM rule-list group assignments.\nThe following rule-lists are provided in the sample rules.\nList\nDescription\npronghorn-system\nApplied to the Itential Platform\npronghorn\ngroup.\npronghorn-users\nApplied to the Itential Platform user groups.\nadmins\nApplied to\npronghorn\nand\nadmins\ngroups.\nBe sure to adjust the groups associated with these rule-lists to ensure they are mapped to the user accounts appropriately.\nInstall NACM Rules in NSO\nThe attached file\nsample-nacm-rules.xml\ncan be loaded into the NSO CDB using the\nload merge\nfeature of the\nncs_cli\n. Use the following commands to load the sample NACM rules.\nncs_cli -u admin -C\nconfig\nload merge sample-nacm-rules.xml\ncommit dry-run\ncommit\nConfigure Device Whitelists\nThe sample NACM rules contain a rule-list for whitelisting devices to the users group. Configure the sample rule-list or create your own rule-lists to associate devices with groups of users. Add devices to the users whitelist.\nncs_cli -u admin -C\nconfig\nnacm rule-list whitelist-devices rule permit-device-mydevicename path /devices/device[name='mydevicename'] action permit\ncommit\nNote:\nIn a NACM enabled system, any new device added to the system needs to have its groups defined at the time of device turn up. This applies to both manual configuration of the devices in NSO as well as any device turn up workflows that are turning up new devices on the network.\nConfigure Service Whitelists\nThe sample NACM rules contain a rule-list for whitelisting service instances to the users group. Configure the sample rule-list or create your own rule-lists to associate services with groups of users. Add all service instances for a model to the users whitelist.\nncs_cli -u admin -C\nconfig\nnacm rule-list whitelist-services rule permit-service-cisco-ios path /services/cisco-ios action permit\ncommit\nAlternately, you can add a single instance to the users whitelist.\nncs_cli -u admin -C\nconfig\nnacm rule-list whitelist-services rule permit-service-cisco-ios-101 path /services/cisco-ios[vlan=101] action permit\ncommit\nNote:\nIn a NACM enabled system, any new service instance added to the system needs to have its groups defined. Service instances may be restricted to an individual group or made accessible to multiple groups with the appropriate NACM rules.\nNSO NETCONF Events in Workflows\nConfigure workflows in Itential Platform to wait for Cisco NSO northbound NETCONF event notifications before proceeding.\nCisco NSO emits notifications over NETCONF for various events that occur within its system. The NSO Adapter can be configured to listen to NSO NETCONF event streams and the Itential Platform Event System can be configured to consume and process these events within a workflow.\nConfigure NSO NETCONF Event Streams\nEvent Streams are configured in NSO within the\nncs.conf\nfile. NSO allows the following event streams to be configured:\nncs-alarms\nncs-events\ndevice-notifications\nservice-state-changes\nNETCONF\nThis example shows how to configure an\nncs-alarms\nevents stream inside the NSO\nncs.conf\nfile.\n<notifications>\n    <event-streams>\n\n      <!-- This is the builtin stream used by NCS to generate northbound -->\n      <!-- notifications whenever the alarm table is changed. -->\n      <!-- See tailf-ncs-alarms.yang -->\n      <!-- If you are not interested in NCS northbound netconf notifications -->\n      <!-- remove this item since it does consume some CPU -->\n      <stream>\n        <name>ncs-alarms</name>\n        <description>NCS alarms according to tailf-ncs-alarms.yang</description>\n        <replay-support>false</replay-support>\n        <builtin-replay-store>\n          <enabled>false</enabled>\n          <dir>./state</dir>\n          <max-size>S10M</max-size>\n          <max-files>50</max-files>\n        </builtin-replay-store>\n      </stream>\n  </event-streams>\n</notifications>\nNote:\n: Every stream that is configured must be defined within\nncs.conf\nregardless if it supports replay. NSO logs notifications and a NETCONF client can ask for logged notifications if replay support is enabled.\nConfigure NSO Adapter to Listen to NETCONF Streams\nAdapter NSO can be configured to define which NSO NETCONF event streams to subscribe to. The list of event streams are defined in adapter properties, with the key\nnetconfSubscriptions\n. The NSO adapter must be restarted after the adapter properties are updated in order to listen to the NSO event streams. The\nnetconfSubscriptions\nvalues should correspond to the desired NSO NETCONF streams defined in NSO\nncs.conf\n.\nExample Configuration\nThis is an example of\nadapter-nso\nproperties with the\nnetconfSubscriptions\nkey defined.\n{\n        \"id\": \"NSO\",\n        \"type\": \"NSO\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"netconfSubscriptions\": [\n                \"ncs-events\",\n                \"ncs-alarms\",\n                \"device-notifications\",\n                \"service-state-changes\"\n            ],\n            \"http\": {\n                \"host\": \"localhost\",\n                \"port\": 8080\n            },\n            \"netconf\": {\n                \"host\": \"localhost\",\n                \"port\": 2022,\n                \"protocol\": \"ssh\"\n            },\n            \"ssh\": {\n                \"port\": 22\n            },\n            \"credentials\": {\n                \"user\": \"admin\",\n                \"passwd\": \"admin\"\n            },\n            \"commitWait\": 5000,\n            \"commitQueue\": false\n        },\n        \"groups\": [],\n        \"brokers\": [\n            \"device\",\n            \"method\",\n            \"service\"\n        ]\n    }\nWorkflow Configuration\nThe Workflow Engine\neventListener\ntask is used to listen for events from applications and adapters deployed inside the platform.\nFigure 1: Event Listener Task\nNote:\nRefer to the\neventListenerJob task reference\nfor more information.\nWhen a job is created, it will commence to process all the tasks that it can, but upon reaching the\neventListener\ntask it will wait in a\nrunning\nstate until it receives an event. The actual event that it is waiting for can be configured within the task itself.\nFigure 2: Event Listener Input Dialog\nDefined Event Listener Inputs\nInput\nDescription\nEvent Source\nThis is the application or adapter that will publish the event. For NSO notifications the NSO adapter will be the source and as the adapter is deployed in the\n@itential\nnamespace, it is important to provide the fully qualified location of the source. In the majority of cases you will use the value of\n@itential/adapter-nso\n; however, if you have multiple NSO adapters deployed then you need to ensure that you specify the correct adapter from which the event will be published.\nEvent Topic\nThis is the name of the topic to which the event will be published. For NETCONF this will be the name of the event stream. In the example dialog shown above, all events will be captured from the\nservice-state-changes\nNETFCONF stream.\nEvent Schema Filter\nBy adding a JSON schema to this field, the task can be configured to execute only when the event that it receives contains specific data that was defined by the schema filter. When the event is captured by the task, the payload of the event will be compared with the JSON schema defined in this field, and the task will only process if there is a match.\nEvent Schema Filter Examples\nThis example will process the\neventListener\ntask only when the following payload is received.\n{\n    \"eventTime\": \"2019-09-19T18:56:14.227091+01:00\",\n    \"plan-state-change\": {\n        \"service\": {\n            \"_\": \"/l3vpn:l3vpn-simple-svc[l3vpn:name='IAP']\"\n        },\n        \"component\": \"self\",\n        \"state\": {\n            \"_\": \"ncs:init\"\n        },\n        \"operation\": \"created\",\n        \"status\": \"reached\"\n    }\n}\nThe JSON schema for the\nEvent Schema Filter\nwould be defined as:\n{\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"eventTime\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"default\": \"2019-09-19T18:56:14.227091+01:00\",\n            \"examples\": [\n                \"2019-09-19T18:56:14.227091+01:00\"\n            ],\n            \"format\": \"date-time\"\n        },\n        \"plan-state-change\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"service\": {\n                    \"type\": \"object\",\n                    \"properties\": {\n                        \"_\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\",\n                            \"default\": \"/l3vpn:l3vpn-simple-svc[l3vpn:name='IAP']\",\n                            \"enum\": [\n                                \"/l3vpn:l3vpn-simple-svc[l3vpn:name='IAP']\"\n                            ]\n                        }\n                    },\n                    \"required\": [\n                        \"_\"\n                    ],\n                    \"additionalProperties\": false\n                },\n                \"component\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"default\": \"self\",\n                    \"examples\": [\n                        \"self\"\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"state\": {\n                    \"type\": \"object\",\n                    \"properties\": {\n                        \"_\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\",\n                            \"default\": \"ncs:init\",\n                            \"examples\": [\n                                \"ncs:init\"\n                            ]\n                        }\n                    },\n                    \"required\": [\n                        \"_\"\n                    ],\n                    \"additionalProperties\": false\n                },\n                \"operation\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"default\": \"created\",\n                    \"examples\": [\n                        \"created\"\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"status\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"default\": \"reached\",\n                    \"examples\": [\n                        \"reached\"\n                    ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"required\":\n                \"service\",\n                \"component\",\n                \"state\",\n                \"operation\",\n                \"status\"\n            ],\n            \"additionalProperties\": false\n        }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\n        \"eventTime\",\n        \"plan-state-change\"\n    ],\n    \"additionalProperties\": false\n}\nNote:\nIf there is no need to filter on the payload and you simply want the task to execute when it receives a specific\nEvent Topic\n, then an empty JSON object\n{}\nshould be set within the\nEvent Schema Filter\nfield.\nItential Tools Rules Engine\nThe Itential Tools Rules Engine allows users to define scripts that can be executed prior to NSO command-sets being executed. These scripts will modify (add or change) values in the NSO command-sets prior to their execution.\nThe rules engine has two parts: a rule engine and a script engine. The script engine reads the script files that have been defined for the command that is passed in, and then reads in the defined rules before it finally passes the rules to the rule engine to be processed.\nThe following files are required:\nFile\nName\nDescription\ncommand file\ndl_command.json\nThis file is used to associate the command name to the script name.\nrule script\n<name of the script>.dls\nThis file will define the script. It is generated by the user who creates the script.\nDevelopment Tools and Libraries\nThe following tools and libraries can be used for development and testing of the Itential Tools Rules Engine. The main framework for the Java-based application will be the Java Spring framework.\nTesting Tool\nDescription\nMockito\nA mocking framework for unit testing.\nTestNG\nA testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit that is designed to cover all categories of testing. The functionality of TestNG includes support for annotations and concurrent testing, along with several other features. TestNG requires JDK 7 or higher.\nSystem Design\nThe Itential Tools Rules Engine has three functional areas:\nScript Engine\nRule Engine\nScript Validation Engine\nFigure 3: Itential Tools Rules Engine Design\nScript Engine\nThe Script Engine is the main driver for script processing. It receives the command file that contains the request to modify the NSO command-set. The following processes are performed in the Script Engine:\nRead in the command file.\nLocate the command to get the script file to execute.\nRead in the script file that needs to be executed. This file will have the defined rules to execute against the NSO command-set.\nThe rule engine will be called to process the rules.\nThe NSO command-set will be modified appropriately.\nThe modified command-set will be returned to the calling system.\nAny errors encountered along the way will be handled appropriately and returned to the calling system.\nRule Engine\nThe Rule Engine is responsible for processing each rule. The input parameters will be the rule and the NSO command-set. The modified NSO command-set will be its output parameter. The following steps will be performed:\nReceive parameters.\nDetermine which rule to process.\nPerform the rule process and modify the NSO command-set.\nReturn the modified NSO command-set.\nHandle any errors and pass back to Script Engine for its error handler to process.\nScript Validation Engine\nThe Script Validation Engine will validate if the script has the correct format and the commands that are contained in the script are valid commands with the correct number of parameters required for the command type.\nIf any of the validations fail, a custom java exception will be thrown with the appropriate error message and code, and then passed back to the calling system to be handled appropriately.\nValidation\nDescription\nParameter (required)\nScript name.\nChecks\nEach command must be terminated with a semicolon. Each command will be validated for a valid number of parameters.\nValidation Commands\n$DLC_REPLACE\nFour (4) parameters:\n1st - Any String\n2nd - Any String\n3rd - Int value\n4th - Int Value\n$DLC_INSERT\nFive (5) parameters:\n1st - Any String\n2nd - Any String\n3rd - Before or After value\n4th - Int Value\n5th - Int value\nRule Command Format and Usage\nUsage\nFormat\nReplace\n$DLC_REPLACE(\"original string\",\"new string\", occurrence, num)\nInsert Before\n$DLC_INSERT(\"original string\",\"new string\",BEFORE, occurrence, num)\nInsert After\n$DLC_INSERT(\"original string\",\"new string\",AFTER, occurrence, num)\nArguments\nArgument\nDescription\noriginal string\nWhat the command is looking for.\nnew string\nWhat will be added. This will also support the following escape characters:\n\\t - tab, \\n - new line, \\r - return\n. Support of additional options as defined in the section \"Supported Options within the 'new string' Argument\" below.\noccurrence\nNumber that indicates the starting position of the original string before it begins to execute the rule. For example, if there are three (3) instances of the original string and the occurrence is two (2), then the command would start processing at instance two (2).\nnum\nNumber of times the action occurs 0-x (0=all of them).  For example, if there are 4 matches of original string and occurrence=3, then only the first three original strings will have the replacement.\nNote:\nIn this scenario, this works in conjunction with the Occurrence setting such that if Occurrence=3 and Num=3, then only two (2) replacements would occur (i.e. the third and fourth) although Num=3.\nSupported Options within the \"new string\" Argument\n$STRING\nSyntax:\n$STRING['my string'|'2nd string'|'3rd string']\nParameters:\n$STRING\n- A single value or and array or string separated by a a pipe (\"|\") symbol that will be printed out. An array will cause a loop will occur.\n$LOOP\nSyntax:\n$LOOP[{start}-{end}|$STRING['{string to print out}']$LOOP_VAR]\nParameters:\n{start}:[int]\n- The starting number of the loop.\n{end}:[int]\n- The ending number of the loop.\n{string to print out}:[string]\n- Any string you want to print out.\n$LOOP_VAR:[int]\n- The integer value of the current loop iteration that will be printed out where it appears either before or after the\n$STRING[]\noption.\nNote\n: Multiple references to\n$LOOP_VAR\nare allowed and supported.\nExample\n$DLC_INSERT(\"access-list\",\"new text here\",AFTER,1);\n$DLC_INSERT(\"access-list\",\"new text here\",BEFORE,1);\n$DLC_INSERT(\"\",\"\\n$LOOP[1-100|$STRING['vlan ']$LOOP_VAR]\\n\",AFTER,1,1);\n$DLC_INSERT(\"\",\"\\n$STRING['my string'|'2nd string'|'3rd string']\\n\",BEFORE,1,1)\nImplementation Design\nImplementation of the designed Rule Engine will include the following features:\nIntegration into the current\nitential-tools\njava application.\nA mechanism for the system to refresh the list of commands available to it without a required restart of\nitential-tools\n.\nAn option to bypass the refresh feature.\nThe ability of users to update the commands and scripts.\nRule Engine Integration\nTo integrate the new Rule Engine into the itential-tools application, the\njava jar file\ngenerated by the Rule Engine application would need to be included in the private-jar or the shared-jar directory to build the itential-tools application.\nThe\ncom.itential.datalore_utils.ScriptEngine\npackage would need to be imported into the class that is calling it. Below is a code sample to execute the command.\nimport com.itential.datalore_utils.ScriptEngine;\n\nScriptEngine scriptEngine = new ScriptEngine(sCommand, sNSOCommandSet);\n\ntry {\n    sNSOCommandSet = scriptEngine.processCommand();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\nIntegration Features\nFeature\nDescription\nRefresh command list\nCurrently, the command list is re-read every time processing of the command is executed.\nBypass option\nA configuration parameter called\nbypassRuleEngine\ncan be defined for\nitential-tools\nand passed to it. This would be defined in the application that is calling the feature set. If this parameter is not passed to itential-tools then a default value of TRUE would be set for the parameter and bypass this feature.\nUpdate command/script by user\nIn the first release of this feature, all commands/scripts will be manually created/edited and copied to the installed location. In the initial release, no will be UI available to support any script manipulation.\nConfigure NSO for SSL\nThe following steps provide instructions to configure SSL between NSO and Itential Platform.\nNSO SSL Configuration\nUpload NSO host and CA X.509 certificates to the NSO host\n$CERT_DIR\n.\nCopy the NSO host private key and signed certificate to the NSO configuration directory.\nNCS_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/ncs\ncp $NSO_SERVER_PRIV_KEY $NCS_CONFIG_DIR/ssl/cert/host.key\ncp $CERT_DIR/$NSO_SERVER_CERTIFICATE $NCS_CONFIG_DIR/ssl/cert/host.cert\nTrust the CA certificate and adjust for your platform.

We assume only one NSO instance manages a given device, and no other devices use that exact same name.\nItential does not support having multiple NSO instances having\nservice models\nof the same name/path. We assume only one NSO instance manages a given service model, and no other service models use that exact same name/path.\nAssuming the following LSA architecture:\nAn ‚Äúupper‚Äù NSO service that has service models defined.\nOne or more ‚Äúlower‚Äù NSO services that connect to devices.\nYou can then do the following setup in Itential Platform:\nCreate an\nadapter-nso\ninstance and point it to the upper node.\nCreate an additional\nadapter-nso\ninstance for every lower node and point it to a lower node.\nWith this setup, you should then be able to use service models (e.g., with tasks such as\nsaveInstances\n) and perform device management (e.g., with Configuration Manager).\nFor more context, NSO can also utilize an Itential Platform ‚Äúbroker‚Äù to further support this setup. When an app task like\nsaveInstances\nis used, you provide the device name to the task. At that point the Itential Platform broker will query all\nadapter-nso\ninstances to see which one has that service model, and then use that adapter instance. The same principle applies to any tasks which directly interact with devices. For example, the golden config feature in Configuration Manager utilizes a broker to know which\nadapter-nso\ninstances manage which device.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings":

This article provides several best practices and suggested methods of complying with such policies for on-premises Itential Platform and IAG installations.\n‚ö†\nItential Platform is\nnot\na system of record. Itential strongly recommends that you specify a retention policy that suits your business needs.\nItential Platform\nItential Platform uses MongoDB to store application and instance data. Itential recommends that regular backups of the Mongo database are performed and backup data is stored in a separate location for safekeeping and recovery requirements. The specific  Itential Platform\n.bin\nfile used for installation should also be retained to facilitate a re-install to exact specifications should restoration be necessary.\nItential Automation Gateway\nIAG maintains host files, scripts, playbooks, and custom modules on a Linux file system. Those file locations should be backed up periodically at scheduled times using\ncron\njobs.\nData Storage Size\nIn the broader context of data preservation and ensuring accessible data backups:\nCheck the configuration and default directory size. The maximum storage size for backup data is often limited.\nAvoid archiving long running workflows.\nMake large job documents modular. In MongoDB,\nGridFS\nis used for storing files larger than 16 MB.\nLog Rotation\nLog data should be gathered from a rolling (rollover) log. As a recommended default, a rolling log should be distributed across 99 files over time (this number can be adjusted lower). To keep the logging system within specified space limits, rolled log files can be emptied (purged) whenever the log directory reaches a particular size and space is needed, or whenever the active log file generated by debug and trace has reached its file size threshold.\nChecklist\nUse the following checklist as an aid to help guide you through the process of archiving and performing backup operations.\nOperation\nRecommendations\n‚òê\nTake snapshot and dump MongoDB data.\n- Can be the entire Mongo database, if no CI/CD process in place to repair workflows, JSTs, or forms.\n- Can also be only jobs, tasks, Golden Config compliance collections, and LifeCycle Manager entities (2023.1).\n-All data files should be zipped and stored in a separate location.\n‚òê\nSet log rolling to 99 files.\n- Rollover log threshold can be adjusted to a lower file number.\n- Configure a time-based policy to purge rollover logs.\n‚òê\nArchive IAG assets.\n- A CI/CD process should be used to manage hosts, scripts, playbooks, etc.\n- All assets should be zipped and placed in a storage archive for snapshot purposes.\n‚òê\nBackup device inventory\n‚ö†\nIf using an internal inventory in IAG, backup the SQLite database that holds the device data.\n‚òê\nSet a frequency for retention and purging.\n- 30 days is the minimum standard for purging stale data.\n- 60-90 days or longer is the minimum standard for retaining data, depending on storage, organizational policy, and business needs.\nCollections\nItential recommends the following list of MongoDB collections be included in a data backup.\nCollection Name\nDescription\njob_history\nNumber of jobs in the system over a period of time.\njob_output\nOutput generated after running a workflow.\njobs\nJob documents.\nwfe_job_metrics\nWorkflow Engine metrics data for workflows.\nwfe_task_metrics\nWorkflow Engine performance data on tasks within workflows.\nucm_configs\nConfiguration backups.\nucm_compliance_reports\nCompliance reports.\nAdditional Collections\nWhile additional collections from Lifecyle Manager (LCM) can be archived and cleaned (purged), the cadence can vary based on policy and business need. Some will find this type of data is valid for several years, while others may only want to maintain LCM data that covers the last 12-months. Since LCM collections are comprised of integral state data and resource models for network configuration, Itential strongly recommends that you specify what LCM collections to store, where they should be stored and for how long.\nArchiving Jobs (2023.2.0)\nThis section provides practices and recommendations as they relate to archiving jobs in the\nIP/2023.2\nrelease.\nJob Data Collections\nAll job variable data in the 2023.2 release version, as well as incoming and outgoing task data, has been moved out of the job and task collections.\nFor data\nless than 16MB\n, it will live in a collection called\njob_data\n.\nFor data\ngreater than 16MB\n, it will live in the\nGridFS\nbucket in MongoDB, which uses two collections named\njob_data.chunks\nand\njob_data.files\n.\nJob ID Required for Archiving\nWhen archiving a job in the 2023.2 release:\nThe\njob_id\nis now required to retrieve all\njob_data\ndocuments for archiving.\nIf the\njob_id\nis is not provided, the overwhelming majority of job-related data will remain in the database.\nJob Data Collection\nAll data in the\njob_data\ncollection can be found by query on\njob_id\n. Below is an example of what data in the\njob_data\ncollection is currently structured to look like.\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"657cc218a4f4b23e8083bff0\"),\n    \"job_id\" : \"f04d7175b9d7452bb718c3c6\",\n    \"data\" : \"example\"\n}\nGridFS Bucket\nFor\nGridFS\n, the data is split between the\njob_data.chunks\nand\njob_data.files\ncollections.\nData in\njob_data.files\ncontains the metadata and all queryable information.\nYou will need to use the MongoDB driver, and consult the official\nGridFS documentation\nfor how to query the GridFS bucket, as well as how to delete files.\nBelow is an example of the\njob_data.files\ndocument structure in the 2023.2 release. You can see that the\njob_id\nis located in\nmetadata.job\nfor the GridFS document.\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"657b6f14c928923a20266cc6\"),\n    \"length\" : 30000002,\n    \"chunkSize\" : 261120,\n    \"uploadDate\" : ISODate(\"2023-12-14T21:09:40.525Z\"),\n    \"filename\" : \"3f0f8f8e-ded1-4c80-8c40-d5eb3657a018\",\n    \"metadata\" : {\n        \"job\" : \"24b0ea5ffbe646b181531585\"\n    }\n}\nSample Commands\nThe following is a list of frequently used commands to support your backup strategy and preserve data.\nMongoDB\nTo run\nmongodump\n:\nmongodump --db=<old_db_name> --collection=<collection_name> --out=data/\nTo run\nmongorestore\n:\nmongorestore --db=<new_db_name> --collection=<collection_name> data/<db_name>/<collection_name>.bson\nLinux\nTo enter edit mode for a Cron job:\ncrontab -e\nTo backup IAG inventory:\nsqlite3 iag.sq3 \".backup 'inventory'\"\nTo restore IAG inventory:\nsqlite3 iag.sq3 \".restore 'inventory'\"\nItential Pre-Builts\nThis pre-built allows Itential Platform users to archive the jobs and tasks collections for the\n2023.1\nand\n2022.1\nrelease only:\nArchive Job Data\n.\nÔÅö\nA forthcoming pre-built will enable job archiving on 2023.2 and later versions; however, the targeted release has yet to be determined.

To ensure a successful upgrade, follow these steps as they are presented in this section.\nBefore Starting\nPrepare for the upgrade:\nObtain an installer for the target version of the Platform.\nReview the official documentation for the\nmongodump\nand\nmongorestore\nutilities on the\nMongoDB Database Tools\nsite.\nItential installer creates a systemd service for the Platform named\npronghorn\n. Make sure you are familiar with\nsystemctl/journalctl\nfor managing and monitoring system services.\nReview all\nProduct Notices\nrelated to your target Itential Platform version and audit your system for any potential impact.\nEnsure that\nbash\nand\ntar\nare installed on the system.\nWarnings & Precautions\nAfter preparing for the upgrade, you will need to consider how long the process will take and when users need to be logged off the system so that you can schedule your upgrade accordingly.\nDuring any major version upgrade of the Platform, all jobs must be in a\n‚Äúcompleted‚Äù\nor\n‚Äúcanceled‚Äù\nstate.\nIn-flight jobs are not supported across major version upgrades of Itential Platform.\nUpgrading the Platform will write to your current database in order to migrate data.\nBe sure to make a backup of your database to allow rollback in the event of an upgrade failure.\nUpgrading the Platform requires a period of downtime.\nUpgrade Process\nFollow these steps to upgrade Legacy platform versions:\nBefore the upgrade can be performed, all jobs must be in a\n‚Äúcompleted‚Äù\nor\n‚Äúcanceled‚Äù\nstate.\nWith the current version of the Platform running, prevent Itential Platform from starting new jobs:\nFor 2023.1 and above, this may be done from the Admin Essentials UI homepage (Admin Essentials ‚Üí Server Information ‚Üí Accept New Jobs).\nFor 2022.1, this must be done by individually disabling job sources:\nAutomation Catalog Automations\nOperations Manager Automation Triggers\nAny non-Itential product that uses the\nstartJobWithOptions\nAPI from Workflow Engine.\nEnsure all jobs are complete, or canceled.\nOnce all jobs are in the appropriate state, shut down Itential Platform.\nCreate a database backup using the\nmongodump\nutility.\nRefer to the\nproperties.json\nfile to identify the correct logical database name.\nIf using\nadapter-local_aaa\nfor any purpose, create a backup of its database also.\nÔÅö\nmongodump\nwill include all logical databases by default if you do not specify\n--db\nMake sure all dependencies align with the\nversion requirements\nof the target version of Itential Platform.\nMake sure your configuration complies with the requirements detailed in the\nInstalling Dependencies\nsection.\nFollow the official documentation when upgrading dependency versions wherever a version upgrade is required.\nÔÅö\nIf this was not done during installation, refer to the\nTemplate Builder Security Dependency\npage to appropriately configure your system for secure Jinja Template execution.\nÔÅö\nIn the\n2023.2\nrelease, the Platform uses\nRedis\nfor message brokering previously handled by RabbitMQ. This requires new configuration settings for Redis which deserve special attention. Please see the\nRedis Dependency\nsection for more detail.\nSet permissive mode and use the installer to upgrade to the new version of Itential Platform.\nsudo setenforce permissive\nsudo bash ./itential-<build-id>_<version>.linux.x86_64.bin --upgrade\nÔÅö\nInstaller Version\nChange\n<build-id>\nand\n<version>\nin the installer binary above to match the version being installed.\nUsing the installer will:\nLeave the existing version of Itential Platform in place.\nInstall the new version of Itential Platform alongside the existing version.\nLink\n/opt/pronghorn/current\nto the newly installed version of Itential Platform.\nStart New Platform Version\nBy default, the\npronghorn\nSystemd service uses\n/opt/pronghorn/current\nto decide which version of Itential Platform to start.\nRun the following to start the new version of the Platform.\nsudo systemctl start pronghorn\nVerify Upgrade\nLog into Itential Platform and audit the following.\nRoles, Accounts, Groups, and associated permissions:\nIf new applications or adapters have been added as part of the upgrade, you may need to assign additional roles to users or groups.\nDatabase Indexes:\nThese are visible in the Admin Essentials application, under the Active Profile. The Platform will also automatically detect missing indexes and display them under\nAlerts\non the Admin Essentials dashboard page.\nWorkflows\n: Audit your workflows for deprecated tasks and altered input schemas.\nÔÅö\nYour organization may require additional verification steps, such as checking adapter configuration and health, etc.\nAfter verifying the correctness of the new install (upgrade), enable new jobs on the system from the Admin Essentials UI.\nRollback Procedure\nIf you encounter any blocking issues while upgrading, use the Rollback Procedure outlined below\nWarnings & Precautions\nThe database must be restored to a previous state to ensure feature compatibility. Any data changes made after your latest backup from the rollback-target version of Itential Platform will be lost.\nRollback Process\nIf you have fully completed the upgrade, and the new version is live, prevent the new version of the Platform from starting new jobs:\nFor\n2023.1 and above\n, this may be done from the Admin Essentials UI homepage (Admin Essentials ‚Üí Server Information ‚Üí Accept New Jobs).\nFor\n2022.1\n, this must be done by individually disabling job sources:\nAutomation Catalog Automations\nOperations Manager Automation Triggers\nAny non-Itential product that uses the\nstartJobWithOptions\nAPI from Workflow Engine.\nIf the new version of the Platform has been live for any length of time, now would be an appropriate time to burn down in-flight jobs, if needed. Note that regardless of job burn-down, you will not have access to post-upgrade jobs after you complete the rollback.\nOnce all jobs are in the appropriate state, shut down the Platform.\nCreate a database backup using the\nmongodump\nutility. This preserves post-upgrade data changes for reference purposes only, and will not be usable in the version of the Platform targeted by the rollback.\nMake sure all dependency versions satisfy the\nrequirements\nof the Platform version targeted by the rollback.\nRestore the previous database state from the archive that was created before upgrading using the\nmongorestore\nutility. Use the\n--drop\nflag to ensure all collections are cleared before importing the archived contents. This will delete any data changes made after the upgrade was completed.\nLink the previous version of the Platform to\n/opt/pronghorn/current\n.\nln -s /opt/pronghorn/<PREVIOUS_IAP_VERSION> /opt/pronghorn/current\nStart the Platform. At this point, Itential Platform should be rolled back to the previous version, with the database as it was prior to upgrading.\nTroubleshooting Help\nRefer to\nCommon Errors\nto help identify and resolve the more frequent errors you may encounter in the upgrade.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/reduced-integration-responses", "title": "Reduced Integration Responses", "text": "Reduced Integration Responses\nPublished on Feb 11, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nDeprecation Notice\nThe following deprecation has been issued in the Itential Platform 6 release, with the change scheduled to be made in the Platform 6.1 version.\nDual-Format Response No Longer Supported\nIntegrations in prior Platform versions supplied response data in two formats: JSON and plain text. This dual-format response was inefficient as it doubled the amount of data flowing through the system, impacting performance and resource usage. To streamline operations and align with best practices, Itential has decided to deprecate the dual response format.\nBeginning with the Platform 6.1 release, integrations will supply a single response format, as determined by the Content-Type HTTP header:\nIf the Content-Type is set to\napplication/json\n, Integrations will automatically parse and return the response as JSON.\nFor any other Content-Type, the response will default to plain text.\nThese changes will improve system efficiency, reduce overhead, and maintain flexibility by allowing users to specify an integration response format through standard HTTP headers. Moreover, the integration response size will be smaller so that the payload does not slow down job execution.\nWhat should I do?\nTo prepare for this change, Itential recommends refactoring workflows to utilize the\n\"body\"\nresponse field within Integration responses. This will ensure the response is parsed correctly by ensuring the Content-Type header correctly identifies the response as JSON or another format (e.g., XML, HTML). For example, if the Content-Type header is identified as:\n\"content-type\": \"application/xml\"\n... then the\n\"body\"\nfield will be formatted as text.\nA sample response is shown below.\n{\n

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/integrations", "title": "Managing Integrations", "text": "Managing Integrations\nPublished on Apr 28, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nAn Integration is a connectivity between Itential and another system (similar to an Adapter). Moreover, it is an instantiation of an Integration Model whereby the Integration uses specific properties from the Model to connect with specific systems. From Admin Essentials, the user interactions for creating and configuring Integrations occur primarily through the dialog views for\nIntegrations\nand\nIntegration Models\n, respectively. Please note that available views, features, and interactions in the UI can be limited based on user permissions.\nSee related page\n‚ûü\nIntegration Models\nCreating Integrations Using Integration Models\nTo create an integration, click the plus (+) sign in the top-left toolbar of Admin Essentials to open the\nCreate\ndialog. Alternately, from the Integration Model details view, you can click the\n+ Integration\nbutton.\nSelect the appropriate\nIntegration Model\nand click the\nSave\nbutton. You will be redirected to another dialog where you select the appropriate\nIntegration Model\nto create and configure your Integration.\nFigure 1: Create Integration\nFigure 2: New Integration from Integration Model\nConfiguring Integration Properties\nFrom the details view, if your integration has properties to edit, they will be displayed here in a form under the\nConfiguration\ntab. If not, properties can be configured and edited in the\nAdvanced View\n(if the user has been granted permission through the generic\nIntegrations - updateIntegration\nmethod). The\nAdvanced View\neditor is enabled (displayed) by using the toggle switch in the upper-right corner.\nFigure 3: Integration Properties\nFrom the\nAdvanced\nview, the\nMore\nbutton (stacked dots icon) next to the toggle switch can be used to clone or delete an integration if the user has been granted permission. Authorization to clone an integration is set with the\nIntegrations - createIntegration\npermission method. To delete, the\nIntegrations - deleteIntegration\nmethod is used.\nFigure 4: Advanced Configuration View\nSSL Configuration for Integrations\nItential has created two SSL configuration properties for Integrations:\nenabled\nand\nrejectUnauthorized\n. These properties are used when making integration requests to a service even if it has an invalid TLS certificate.\nProperty Schema\n\"tls\":{\n   \"enabled\":false,\n   \"rejectUnauthorized\":false\n}\nThe schema allows an integration instance to have configurable TLS properties to enable/disable the\nrejectUnauthorized\nproperty. This will allow users to bypass HTTPS TLS certificate checks.\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\nenabled\nBoolean\nFalse\nEnables certificate request from endpoint and verify retrieved certificate.\nrejectUnauthorized\nBoolean\nFalse\nIf true, the request will reject a connection that is not authorized with valid CAs. This option only has an effect if \"enabled\" is on.\nIntegration Logging\nLog Levels are controlled by configurations within Admin Essentials. Increasing the size of the log level under the\nLogging\ntab will impact\nall of Itential Platform\n, not just Integrations.\nMoreover, if the Syslog properties are not configured in the Advanced View of the Integration, the user will be unable to change that property in the Logging tab.\nRelated Reading:\nEvent Logs & Logging\nItential Developers: Log Class\nIntegration Responses\nWhenever an integration makes a call, and that call fails to connect to an external system, the information that's necessary for troubleshooting the failed integration task is now viewable by Itential Platform users, including the:\nMethod and action (GET, POST, PATCH, etc)\nURL (protocol, host, basepath, path)\nResponse object (status code, body)\nDebugging information\nThis feature enhancement applies to both on-premises and cloud Itential Platform users to ensure they receive the diagnostic information that's needed for troubleshooting when an integration call fails.\nOutput Errors\nWhen an Integration task is not successful in its call to an external system, an output error is returned along with useful information to help troubleshoot the error that is presented.\nWhen the Integration task fails because it does not have the proper information to make the API call, it will output the error as a\nstring\n, with a message to indicate why it could not make the API call.\nWhen the Integration task fails because the API call was processed by the target server and returned a failure, it will output the error as an\nobject\nwith fields in its response body.\nResponse Body\nItential has standardized the response body of an Integration task with additional information to help understand why an output error was returned.\nResponse Field\nDescription\nok\nBoolean value stating whether the response was successful.\nmethod\nHTTP verb that indicates the type of call, e.g.,\n\"method\": \"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"PATCH\", \"DELETE\"\nurl\nThe URL of the call that failed, e.g.,\n\"url\": \"https://server.com/api/v1/some/resource\"\nstatus\nThe HTTP status code returned by the server.\nstatusText\nDescription of the HTTP status code.\nheaders\nAn array of response headers of the call.\nbody\nThe body of the response. Provides information when Itential Platform is able to parse the response. If the error response is not JSON, Itential Platform is not able to parse the response, and the response is then conveyed to a\ntext\nfield.\ntext\nGenerated when Itential Platform cannot parse the body of the response.\nparseError\nRaised when a parsing error has occurred.\n‚ìò\nNote:\nFor some workflows, e.g.\nclientCredentials\n, the Itential platform will automatically request new access tokens or use refresh tokens. This may result in an error whereby the Integration task was a\n\"GET\"\nbut the error object was induced by a\n\"POST\"\nto\n\"api/v1/token\"\n. In this scenario, because the token request failed, the Integration could not even attempt the API call, which is why an error object is returned.\nExample: Success Response Body\nA\nSuccessful\nsample response body is presented below.\n{\n  \"ok\": true,\n  \"method\": \"GET\",\n  \"url\": \"http://localhost:8088/pet/7119\",\n  \"status\": 200,\n  \"statusText\": \"OK\",\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"connection\": \"close\",\n    \"content-type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"date\": [\n      \"Fri\",\n      \"05 May 2023 17:48:43 GMT\"\n    ],\n    \"transfer-encoding\": \"chunked\",\n    \"x-powered-by\": \"Express\"\n  },\n  \"body\": {\n    \"id\": 7119,\n    \"tags\": [],\n    \"status\": \"available\",\n    \"name\": \"Lotus\",\n    \"photoUrls\": [\n      \"https://patchpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatIsanAmericanBlackLab.jpg.webp\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\nExample: Error Response Body\nA sample\nError\nresponse body is presented below.\n{\n  \"ok\": false,\n  \"url\": \"https://petstore.swagger.io/api/v3/store/invenxxxtory\",\n  \"status\": 404,\n  \"statusText\": \"Not Found\",\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"access-control-allow-headers\": [\n      \"Content-Type\",\n      \"api_key\",\n      \"Authorization\"\n    ],\n    \"access-control-allow-methods\": [\n      \"GET\",\n      \"POST\",\n      \"DELETE\",\n      \"PUT\"\n    ],\n    \"access-control-allow-origin\": \"*\",\n    \"cache-control\": \"must-revalidate,no-cache,no-store\",\n    \"connection\": \"keep-alive\",\n    \"content-length\": \"309\",\n    \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\",\n    \"date\": [\n      \"Wed\",\n      \"26 Feb 2025 14:02:35 GMT\"\n    ],\n    \"server\": \"Jetty(9.2.9.v20150224)\"\n  },\n  \"text\": \"<html>\\n<head>\\n<meta http-equiv=\\\"Content-Type\\\" content=\\\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\\\"/>\\n<title>Error 404 Not Found</title>\\n</head>\\n<body><h2>HTTP ERROR 404</h2>\\n<p>Problem accessing /api/v3/store/invenxxxtory.

This was inconvenient since tokens would expire relatively soon (as early as 30 minutes), and it created a less than desirable user experience since the expired token could no longer be used to authenticate automation requests.\nThe\nnew Integration Token Management feature\nprogrammatically retrieves authentication tokens by using the properties provided by the Integration Model for schema integration. Specifically, the feature works by reading the\nsecuritySchema\nproperty on the Integration Model schema.\nThere are two types of configurations available at this time:\npassword\nand\nclientCredentials\n. These must be manually configured in the Integration Model that is imported.\n‚ö†\nImportant Note:\nAlthough Itential designed this new feature to work for as many services as possible, it is important to note that\nnot\nall services will be compatible with the\npassword\nor\nclientCredentials\nconfiguration. It is incumbent upon every user to check the service to see if these configurations are provided. Itential hopes to provide more usable configurations in the future.\nProperty Configurations\nThis section illustrates how to set the properties for the\npassword\nand\nclientCredentials\nconfiguration.\nAn example for\npassword\nis shown in\nFigure 1\n.\nFigure 1: Password\nAn example for\nclientCredentials\nis shown in\nFigure 2\n.\nFigure 2: Client Credentials\nNotice the only difference is the\nproperty\nname in the\nflows\nobject, and in the case of\nFigure 1\nthere is a\nrefreshUrl\nparameter included in the\npassword\nflow.\nIntegration Configurations\nDepending on which configuration is used, the user will see a specific configuration available on the\nIntegration Details\npage. The user will then have to fill-in the\nauthentication\nfields (see figures below) in order for the programmatic token retrieval to work properly.\nFor more detail on using Integrations, see\nConfiguring Integrations\n.\nAuthentication\nBelow are the configuration parameters used to support authentication.\nAuthentication Parameters\nDescription\nclient_id\nclient_secret\nProvided by the service that is in use.

The default value is set to\nBearer\n.\nexpires_in\nLength of time that the\naccess_token\nwill be valid.\nexpires_at\nTime in which the token will expire.

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/user-group-references-itential-platform", "title": "User Group References", "text": "User Group References\nUpdated on\nFeb 20, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nWithin Itential Platform is the representation of groups. Groups can be uniquely identified by either a database id, or a name and provenance pair, where the provenance is the name of the AAA adapter from which the group originated. This guide discusses best practices for group representation and illustrates how to query documents with referenced groups.\nGuidelines\nIf you have no custom applications, no need to take any additional actions. Our migration scripts will handle the migration of internal Itential Platform data.\nIf your custom applications are not RBAC enabled, no need to take any additional actions.\nIf your custom applications are RBAC enabled, you will need to plan for an application update to leverage the new group reference APIs and a script to migrate data from names to group ids.\nBest Practices\nRecommended best practices for group references are summarized below.\nGroup References in Database Documents\nA database document should focus on maximizing leverage from the database system. Therefore, references to groups should be made via the database id. In MongoDB, groups are keyed with\nObjectId\n, and the reference should use that type as well. This allows applications to use\n$lookup\nin the MongoDB aggregation pipeline to sort and filter by group fields. This also allows for more efficient querying when group data should be retrieved. Examples of how the database system is leveraged are shown in later sections.\nDisplaying Groups in the UI\nIt is not reasonable for users to choose groups from a list of\ngroup ids\n. User lists and references should be displayed in the UI using the group name and provenance fields. Group name only is no longer sufficient, as the user may need to distinguish between similarly named groups in different systems.\nGroup References in APIs\nGroup references in API depends somewhat on how existing APIs and documents are structured. But it makes sense that both group ids and name/provenance pairs would be accepted and returned by APIs in differing circumstances.\nIn cases where\ngroup ids\nare being exposed, they should appear as strings in JSON. APIs must take on the burden of validating ids, converting them to\nObjectId\nwhen appropriate, and testing for equality using the appropriate methods.\nHow to Query Documents with Referenced Groups\nPresuming the above practices are implemented, you can leverage the MongoDB aggregation pipeline. For the following examples, let's presume the following group document exists.\nGroup Document Example\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5aebd2ffe2c5b5614927362d\"),\n    \"provenance\" : \"Local AAA\",\n    \"name\" : \"group1\",\n    \"description\" : \"Sample Group\",\n    \"memberOf\" : [ ... ],\n    \"assignedRoles\" : [ ... ],\n    ...\n}\nDenormalization of group data (e.g., keeping a copy of the username alongside the group id) creates a maintenance issue in cases where the group data has changed, but your copy has not. Denormalization of group data is not recommended. Instead, you want to load the group data at the time of the query in order to include it in the API response.\nExample Workflow\n{\n    \"_id\": \"b6517ac9-a8fc-4621-902b-174458005c90\",\n    \"name\": \"Example Workflow\",\n    \"tasks\": { ... },\n    \"transitions\": { ... },\n    \"created\": \"5/18/2018, 9:32:50 AM\",\n    \"created_by\" : {\n        \"id\": ObjectId(\"5aebd2fae2c5b5614927362b\")\n    },\n    \"last_updated\" : \"5/18/2018, 9:33:31 AM\",\n    \"last_updated_by\" : {\n        \"id\": ObjectId(\"5aebd2fae2c5b5614927362b\")\n    },\n    \"groups\" : [\n        ObjectId(\"5aebd2ffe2c5b5614927362d\")\n    ]\n}\nWith this example query, the document references the user that created it. Additionally, you want to include the group's human-readable components in your hypothetical API response.\nExample Query 1\n[\n    {\n        \"id\": \"b6517ac9-a8fc-4621-902b-174458005c90\",\n        \"name\": \"Example Workflow\",\n        \"groups\": [{\n            \"id\": \"5aebd2ffe2c5b5614927362d\",\n            \"provenance\": \"Local AAA\",\n            \"name\": \"group1\",\n            \"description\": \"Sample Group\"\n        }]\n    }\n]\nThis example query can produce the desired data in a single request to MongoDB.\nExample Query 2\nconst workflowListWithInlineGroupsPipeline = [\n    {\n        $lookup: {\n            from: 'groups',\n            localField: 'groups',\n            foreignField: '_id',\n            as: 'groups'\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        $project: {\n            name: 1,\n            created: 1,\n            groups: 1\n        }\n    }\n];\n\nconst workflowList = await workflowsCollection.aggregate(workflowListWithInlineGroupsPipeline).toArray();\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "User Group References"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Guidelines"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Best Practices"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Group References in Database Documents"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Displaying Groups in the UI"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Group References in APIs"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "How to Query Documents with Referenced Groups"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Example Workflow"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Example Query 1"}, {"level": "h3", "text": "Example Query 2"}], "code_blocks": ["{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5aebd2ffe2c5b5614927362d\"),\n    \"provenance\" : \"Local AAA\",\n    \"name\" : \"group1\",\n    \"description\" : \"Sample Group\",\n    \"memberOf\" : [ ... ],\n    \"assignedRoles\" : [ ... ],\n    ...\n}", "{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5aebd2ffe2c5b5614927362d\"),\n    \"provenance\" : \"Local AAA\",\n    \"name\" : \"group1\",\n    \"description\" : \"Sample Group\",\n    \"memberOf\" : [ ... ],\n    \"assignedRoles\" : [ ... ],\n    ...\n}", "{\n    \"_id\": \"b6517ac9-a8fc-4621-902b-174458005c90\",\n    \"name\": \"Example Workflow\",\n    \"tasks\": { ... },\n    \"transitions\": { ... },\n    \"created\": \"5/18/2018, 9:32:50 AM\",\n    \"created_by\" : {\n        \"id\": ObjectId(\"5aebd2fae2c5b5614927362b\")\n    },\n    \"last_updated\" : \"5/18/2018, 9:33:31 AM\",\n    \"last_updated_by\" : {\n        \"id\": ObjectId(\"5aebd2fae2c5b5614927362b\")\n    },\n    \"groups\" : [\n        ObjectId(\"5aebd2ffe2c5b5614927362d\")\n    ]\n}", "{\n    \"_id\": \"b6517ac9-a8fc-4621-902b-174458005c90\",\n    \"name\": \"Example Workflow\",\n    \"tasks\": { ... },\n    \"transitions\": { ... },\n    \"created\": \"5/18/2018, 9:32:50 AM\",\n    \"created_by\" : {\n        \"id\": ObjectId(\"5aebd2fae2c5b5614927362b\")\n    },\n    \"last_updated\" : \"5/18/2018, 9:33:31 AM\",\n    \"last_updated_by\" : {\n        \"id\": ObjectId(\"5aebd2fae2c5b5614927362b\")\n    },\n    \"groups\" : [\n        ObjectId(\"5aebd2ffe2c5b5614927362d\")\n    ]\n}", "[\n    {\n        \"id\": \"b6517ac9-a8fc-4621-902b-174458005c90\",\n        \"name\": \"Example Workflow\",\n        \"groups\": [{\n            \"id\": \"5aebd2ffe2c5b5614927362d\",\n            \"provenance\": \"Local AAA\",\n            \"name\": \"group1\",\n            \"description\": \"Sample Group\"\n        }]\n    }\n]", "[\n    {\n        \"id\": \"b6517ac9-a8fc-4621-902b-174458005c90\",\n        \"name\": \"Example Workflow\",\n        \"groups\": [{\n            \"id\": \"5aebd2ffe2c5b5614927362d\",\n            \"provenance\": \"Local AAA\",\n            \"name\": \"group1\",\n            \"description\": \"Sample Group\"\n        }]\n    }\n]", "const workflowListWithInlineGroupsPipeline = [\n    {\n        $lookup: {\n            from: 'groups',\n            localField: 'groups',\n            foreignField: '_id',\n            as: 'groups'\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        $project: {\n            name: 1,\n            created: 1,\n            groups: 1\n        }\n    }\n];\n\nconst workflowList = await workflowsCollection.aggregate(workflowListWithInlineGroupsPipeline).toArray();", "const workflowListWithInlineGroupsPipeline = [\n    {\n        $lookup: {\n            from: 'groups',\n            localField: 'groups',\n            foreignField: '_id',\n            as: 'groups'\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        $project: {\n            name: 1,\n            created: 1,\n            groups: 1\n        }\n    }\n];\n\nconst workflowList = await workflowsCollection.aggregate(workflowListWithInlineGroupsPipeline).toArray();"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/user-account-references-itential-platform", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/using-query-parameters-in-api-requests-itential-platform"]}

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/event-system-global-service-object", "title": "Event System", "text": "Event System\nUpdated on\nFeb 20, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nThe event system is a global service object named\neventSystem\nthat is available to application developers in the Itential Platform environment. The\neventSystem\nallows a service to publish information to the Itential Platform environment that other services can react to.\nThe event system has three main methods (which are described in this guide):\neventSystem.publish(topic, payload);\n\neventSystem.subscribe(source, topic, handler);\n\neventSystem.unsubscribe(source, topic, handler);\nEvent Definition\nTo define an event that you want your service to publish, add a\ntopics\nsection to the pronghorn.json of your application. For example:\n\"topics\" : {\n    \"launch\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"required\": [\"rocket\"],\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"rocket\": {}\n        }\n    },\n    \"bananas\": {}\n}\nThe above example defines two topics that can be emitted as events by the Itential application,\nlaunch\nand\nbananas\n. The\nlaunch\nobject contains a JSON schema that defines what its event payload should look like. As you can see the property\nrocket\nis required for the event's payload. If it is not present in the payload the event will not be processed. If an event does not match the defined schema it is rejected.\nThe\nbananas\nevent has no requirement for how its payload should look. You can publish as many events as you like.\n\"topics\" : {\n    \"eventName1\": {\n        -JSON Schema-\n    },\n    \"eventName2\": {\n        -JSON Schema-\n    }\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    \"eventNameN\": {\n        -JSON Schema-\n    }\n}\nNamespace\nThese events are automatically namespaced in the system using the model name of the application (e.g.,\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\n). This allows developers to have events with the same name. Hence, the event name \"rocket\" could be used in both\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\nand\n@itential/app-configuration_manager\n.\nRegistration\nWhen an application connects to Itential Platform it automatically sends all of its defined event topics. Itential Platform adds the event topics to the global list it maintains and then broadcasts the updated global list to all other applications. This allows the other applications to subscribe to the new events.\n‚ìò Note:\nCurrently there is no verification of event payload within Itential Platform. This is handled by the\neventSystem\nin the application when it receives an event it is subscribed to.\nSubscription\nTo handle a particular event, call the\neventSystem.subscribe\nmethod. After an event is subscribed to, the event system will call the handler function when it receives the event and verify the payload matches the schema.\neventSystem.subscribe(source, topic, handler)\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\nsource\nstring\nThe application publishing the event. For example:\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\ntopic\nstring\nThe name of the event topic you care about. For example:\nlaunch\nhandler\nfunction\nA handler function that processes the payload data of the event.\nExample\neventSystem.subscribe(\"@itential/app-workflow_engine\", \"launch\", launchHandler);\nUnsubscribing\nTo stop listening for an event, call the\neventSystem.unsubscribe\nmethod. This will cause the event system to stop calling the handler function for a particular event. Unsubscribing tells the event system you no longer care about that event topic.\neventSystem.unsubscribe(source, topic, handler)\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\nsource\nstring\nThe application publishing the event. For example:\n@itential/app-workflow_engine\ntopic\nstring\nThe name of the event topic you no longer care about. For example:\nlaunch\nhandler\nfunction\nA handler function that previously processed the payload of the event.\nExample\neventSystem.unsubscribe(\"@itential/app-workflow_engine\", \"launch\", launchHandler);\nPublish\nTo send an event, call the\neventSystem.publish\nmethod. This will send the event to Itential Platform for broadcast to all the other applications in the Itential Platform environment. Notice there is no source when publishing.

To address the issue, you will need delete this group.\nBefore proceeding, backup the DB using\nmongodump\n. Use a GUI mongo client to run the commands below. Alternatively, you can access the mongo shell with these commands:\nmongo --host localhost --authenticationDatabase <authdb> -u admin -p <password> use pronghorn\ndb.groups.find({name: \"admin\"}).pretty()\nA single document should return matching the admin user. This should reflect 1 record removed.\ndb.groups.remove({name: \"admin\"})\nReturn to the Itential Platform UI and click the\nREFRESH\nbutton to fully refresh the page and reload the page data.\nAt this point the \"admin\" group should no longer be present and you should now be able to use your groups normally.\nJobs (Operations Manager) Not Showing Updates\nThe Jobs UI is not showing any updates after running the upgrade.\nSolution\nThe migration scripts have not ran.

This system will identify invalid schema formats and automatically run a script to convert the schema to the appropriate format.\nIn the majority of cases the script works and makes updating the\npronghorn.json\neasier. However there may be some schema errors the script cannot handle, in which case an error warning will display alerting you to the invalid data and the need for it to be fixed. Once the\npronghorn.json\nis updated, the schema should load.\nThe following are valid types for input and outputs to the pronghorn.json:\n['*', 'enum', 'object', 'string', 'array', 'boolean', 'integer', 'number']\nNotes:\nType\n'enum'\nis not a valid json schema so the type will be set to array\nType\n'*'\nis a valid type, however it should ONLY be used when you really intend for an input/output to be any type. Using this type will limit json validation and could result in errors if bad type is allowed in.\nCommon invalid types include:\njson\n,\njson[]\n,\nstr\n,\nstring[]\nand many other variations.\nExample: Valid pronghorn.json\n\"methods\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"getDevices\",\n    \"summary\": \"Get the list of supported devices from Inventory for the siteId\",\n    \"description\": \"Get all microwave devices for the given siteId defined in inventory, then filter and\nonly return those supported.\",\n    \"roles\": [\n      \"admin\"\n    ],\n    \"route\": {\n      \"path\": \"/:siteId/devices\",\n      \"verb\": \"GET\"\n    },\n    \"input\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"siteId\",\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Site identifier to get equipment for\",\n        \"required\": \"true\",\n        \"in\": \"path\",\n        \"schema\": {\n          \"title\": \"devices\",\n          \"type\": \"object\"\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n   \"output\": {\n         \"name\": \"devices\",\n         \"description\": \"success/failure response object\",\n         \"type\": \"object\",\n         \"schema\": {\n          \"title\": \"devices\",\n          \"type\": \"object\"\n       }\n   },\n   \"task\": true\n},\nSolution\nRun the\nfix-pronghorn_json.js.gz\nscript to fix issues in pronghorn.json.\nDownload the\nscript\nto your folder.\napp-folder_name\nExecute the node command.\nnode fix-pronghorn_json.js pronghorn.json\nPossible responses include:\nResponse\nMessage\nSuccess\npronghorn.json has been updated\nSuccess (no updates required)\nNo methods detected in: pronghorn.json, file skipped\nFailure\npronghorn.json update cancelled due to previous errors\nShould a failure occur, an error should display that provides a hint on how to fix it. Typically invalid JSON or invalid types are the cause; once you have fixed the issue repeat Step 2 (execute node command).\nIf the\npronghorn.json\nupdate is successful, be sure to push the pronghorn.json back to your repository.\nChange directory to the migration script database, then run the migration scripts.\ncd <PRONGHORN_HOME>\ncd ./current/node_modules/@itential/pronghorn-core/migration_scripts\nnode migratePropertiesToDatabase.js\nTask Is Causing Workflow Engine to Stall or Crash\nWhen an upgraded workflow is ran, Workflow Engine (WFE) will either stall or crash when hitting a specific task.\nSolution\nDelete the task and then recreate it.\nError Retrieving Backups, Device Groups, and Golden Configurations\nIn Configuration Manager errors occur when trying to retrieve backups, device groups, or Golden Configurations.\nSolution\nA migration script is needed.\nConfirm MongoDB version is 5.0.\nmongo --version\nRun the migration script in the Configuration Manager folder.\n/node_modules/@itential/app-configuration_manager/migration_scripts\nFor DEV / STAGING environment, execute the node command:\nnode migrate_to_jinja.js dev\nFor PROD environment, execute the node command:\nnode migrate_to_jinja.js\nRestart IAP.\nsudo systemctl restart pronghorn\nTry to retrieve backups, device groups, and Golden Configurations.\nNote: For IAP 2022.1.x and IAP 2023.1.x Only.\nRabbitMQ Not Starting\nRabbitMQ will not start after being upgraded. When investigating the RabbitMQ log file, error messages similar to the following are found:\n[error] <0.237.0> Feature flags: `classic_mirrored_queue_version`: required feature flag not enabled! It must be enabled before upgrading RabbitMQ.\n[error] <0.237.0> Failed to initialize feature flags registry: {disabled_required_feature_flag,\n[error] <0.237.0>                                               classic_mirrored_queue_version}\n[error] <0.237.0>\n[error] <0.237.0> BOOT FAILED\nSolution\nEnable the\nfeature flag\nindicated in the error messages by using the\nrabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag\ncommand.

This frees your automation teams to develop Playbooks in their preferred version of Ansible and deploy them to the same installation of IAG without having to worry about Ansible version compatibility.\nNote\nItential has changed the version number scheme for the Itential Automation Gateway (IAG) application from date-based versioning to semantic versioning. For an explanation of semantic versioning, please visit\nhttps://semver.org/\n. The latest release of IAG (as of August 2024) is IAG 4.3.0.\nThe change in the version number scheme provides clarity for customers who want to understand how future releases of IAG are backwards compatible with earlier releases.

We have also enabled dynamic output with a \"Try it out\" feature within a Swagger-based UI. This page documents OpenAPI documentation in IAP and provides guidance on how it is used.\nAuthorization\nIt is important to know that the ‚ÄúTry it out\" feature is controlled by authorization settings based on the current user. If you do not have permission to call a specific API, the \"Try it out\" feature will return a 401 error, but you will be able to see the documentation for the route. As shown in\nFigure 1\nbelow, it is possible to log in with a token or username/password separately when making these API calls, if desired.\nFigure 1: Authorizations\nSearch Filter\nItential has also implemented a simple filter to make it easier to find the application or adapter specific to the API documentation you wish to see. As shown in\nFigure 2\n, simply input a short string (e.g., ‚Äúadapter‚Äù) as the filter to generate your search results.\nFigure 2: API Search Filter\nAvailable Parameters\nWhen you select an individual method, you can view all the available parameters for that method as defined in the\npronghorn.json\nfile for the relevant application. This may also include default examples, such as when a route takes in a request body. In\nFigure 3\n, some of the expected inputs for the\ngetAdapterModelTypes\nAPI are shown. You can also see they are not required parameters.\nFigure 3: API Request Example\nTo call the ‚ÄúTry it out‚Äù feature, click the\nExecute\nbutton after entering all the relevant inputs (\nFigure 4\n).\nFigure 4: Execute Button for ‚ÄúTry it out‚Äù\nAPI Response\nIf the user making the request has access to the API, the full response will be returned to the user (\nFigure 5\n). In addition, information about response headers along with the time it took to execute the response will be presented.\nFigure 5: API Response Example\nResponse Schema\nAlso documented is the expected schema for the API method and any error codes that may occur. Currently, the only error code that returns for all methods is a 500 response.\nFigure 6\nshows the expected schema for the method when it returns a 200 response, as well the models type\napplication/json\n.\nFigure 6: Response Code and Schema\nCustom Applications\nTo ensure all APIs are included within the UI, all custom applications\nmust\nhave valid JSON schemas defined for each API method. While the accuracy of the JSON schema matching the method‚Äôs input or output is not enforced, ensuring that it does not have any errors according to JSON schema standards will guarantee it is included in the OpenAPI document. An error will be logged for any methods that are marked as invalid, and they will not be viewable from the UI.\nOpenAPI Specification\nThe OpenAPI 3.0 Specification is available through\nGET /help/openapi/\n. The API returns a JSON that conforms to the OpenAPI 3.0 Specification. The required query parameter\nURL\nis the base URL of IAP in which the user wants the specification returned from.\nFor example:\nGET /help/openapi/?url=http://yourhostname.com:3000\nThe returned JSON can be viewed in a browser, or the result can be copied to a different viewing document.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo", "headings": [{"level": "h1", "text": "OpenAPI Documentation"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Authorization"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Search Filter"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Available Parameters"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "API Response"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Response Schema"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "Custom Applications"}, {"level": "h2", "text": "OpenAPI Specification"}], "code_blocks": ["GET /help/openapi/?url=http://yourhostname.com:3000", "GET /help/openapi/?url=http://yourhostname.com:3000"], "tables": [], "links": ["https://docs.itential.com/docs/stop-start-restart-itential-platform-service", "https://docs.itential.com/docs/validated-design-deployment-itential-platform"]}

{"url": "https://docs.itential.com/docs/prebuilt-automation-repository-itential-platform", "title": "Pre-Built Automation Repository", "text": "Pre-Built Automation Repository\nUpdated on\nApr 28, 2025\nExport PDF\nPrev\nNext\nThis guide defines the minimum requirements and process to have a functioning\nPre-built Automation\nrepository. Once configured properly,\nAdmin Essentials\nis able to query the repository and incorporate and manage users' custom Pre-built Automations.\nItential Platform now supports the configuration of custom and multiple Pre-built Automation repositories. This means that users can provide a configuration to fetch Pre-built Automations from their custom Pre-built Automation repository as opposed to previous releases where it was only allowed to pull from Itential's official Pre-built Automation open-source library.\nThe following conventions must be followed in order for Admin Essentials to properly integrate with the custom Pre-Built Automation Repository.\nStructure of a Pre-built Automation Repository\nThe Pre-built Automation Repository must be in\nGitLab\n. Each Pre-built Automation is its own\nGitLab\nrepository. The structure of the repository is outlined in the sections below.\nThe branching strategy within each\nGitLab\nrepository can be customized to whatever convention you want for development purposes; however, in order to properly appear in Admin Essentials, each Pre-built Automation must follow a specific branch naming convention that is considered as the\nrelease\nbranches.\nPre-built Automation Versioning Requirements\nMost Itential Platform releases follow a version convention like the one below:\nx.y.z-2023.1.m\nThe \"2023.1\" equates to the major release of Itential Platform and the \"m\" is the maintenance release.\nIn order for a Pre-built Automation to be consumed by an Itential Platform environment with the above version, the Pre-built Automation must also have that same versioning structure in the\npackage.json\nfile.\nFor example, the version of the Pre-built Automation would have the traditional\nmajor.minor.patch\nwith Semantic Versioning then a dash (\"-\") followed by the corresponding major release of Itential Platform (YYYY.Z) the Pre-built Automation supports and lastly, each change to the prebuilt would increment the maintenance number (the \"m\" in the example above).\nÔÅö\nOne branch can only support one version of Itential Platform. For the version checking features to function properly, these rules must be followed on creation of the Pre-built Automation.\nBranch Naming Requirement for Pre-built Automations\nThe Pre-built Automation also must be tied to a specific release by creating a branch in the repository named with\nrelease/YYYY.Z\n. This versioning scheme is accomplished by having different Git branches to reflect the different release versions.\nFor example, if we have a custom Pre-built Automation the repository branches would be:\n* master\n* release/2021.1 -> consumable by IAP release/2021.1\n* release/2020.2 -> consumable by IAP release/2020.2\n* release/2020.1 -> consumable by IAP release/2020.1\nStructure of a Pre-built Automation\nThe structure of the Pre-built Automation must be strictly followed for the Admin Essentials UI to properly process and display the custom Pre-built Automations. Following the conventions below will ensure the best user experience.\nEach Pre-built Automation must include the following directories and files to be consumable by Itential Platform:\n/bundles/\nREADME.md\nmanifest.json\npackage.json\nartifact.json\nbundles\nThe\nbundles\ndirectory consists of a directory map of all the Itential Platform component files contained within the Pre-built Automation. An example directory structure for a Pre-built Automation that contains one of each component (two transformations) supported in Pre-built Automations would be the following:\n/bundles\n|--> /ac_-_agenda_job\n    |--> automation-catalog-1.json\n|--> /forms\n    |--> form-1.json\n|--> /golden_config\n    |--> golden-config-1.json\n|--> /json_forms\n    |--> json-forms.json\n|--> /mop_template\n    |--> mop-template-1.json\n|--> /mop_analytic_template\n    |--> mop-analytic-template-1.json\n|--> /service_catalog\n    |--> service-catalog-1.json\n|--> /template\n    |--> template-1.json\n|--> /transformation\n    |--> transformation-1.json\n    |--> transformation-2.json\n|--> /workflow\n    |--> workflow.json\nThe JSON files under each sub-directory contain the data for that component type. These files are the exports from an Itential Platform environment.\nREADME.md\nEvery Pre-built Automation is required to have a\nREADME.md\nfile. This is important to describe the contents and use-cases of the Pre-built Automation and will be displayed on the Admin Essentials Browse page as well as when browsing a Pre-built Automation's Details.\nmanifest.json\nThe\nmanifest.json\nfile is a map of all components contained within the Pre-built Automation. This file informs Itential Platform of the content contained in the Pre-built Automation along with the name, type, and location of each component in the bundle.\n{\n    \"bundleName\": \"Custom Pre-built Automation\",\n    \"artifacts\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"Automation Catalog Name 1\",\n        \"name\": \"Automation Catalog Name 1\",\n        \"type\": \"ac-agenda-job\",\n        \"location\": \"/bundles/ac_agenda_jobs/automation-catalog-1.json\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"Form Name 1\",\n        \"name\": \"Form Name 1\",\n        \"type\": \"forms\",\n        \"location\": \"/bundles/forms/form-1.json\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"Golden Config Name 1\",\n        \"name\": \"Golden Config Name 1\",\n        \"type\": \"golden-config\",\n        \"location\": \"/bundles/golden-config/golden-config-1.json\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"Json Form Name 1\",\n        \"name\": \"Json Form Name 1\",\n        \"type\": \"json-forms\",\n        \"location\": \"/bundles/json_forms/json-forms.json\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"MOP Template 1\",\n        \"name\": \"MOP Template 1\",\n        \"type\": \"mop-template\",\n        \"location\": \"/bundles/mop_template/mop-template-1.json\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"MOP Analytic Template 1\",\n        \"name\": \"MOP Analytic Template 1\",\n        \"type\": \"mop-analytic-template\",\n        \"location\": \"/bundles/mop_analytic_template/mop-analytic-template-1.json\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"Service Catalog 1\",\n        \"name\": \"Service Catalog 1\",\n        \"type\": \"service-catalog\",\n        \"location\": \"/bundles/service_catalog/service_catalog-1.json\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"Template 1\",\n        \"name\": \"Template 1\",\n        \"type\": \"template\",\n        \"location\": \"/bundles/template/template-1.json\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"Transformation 1\",\n        \"name\": \"Transformation 1\",\n        \"type\": \"transformation\",\n        \"location\": \"/bundles/transformation/transformation-1.json\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"Workflow Name\",\n        \"name\": \"Workflow Name\",\n        \"type\": \"workflow\",\n        \"location\": \"/bundles/workflow/workflow.json\"\n      }\n    ]\n}\npackage.json\nThe\npackage.json\nfile is similar to the conventions set by\nnpm\n.\n{\n  \"name\": \"Custom Pre-built Automation\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0-2021.1.1\",\n  \"description\": \"A description of the Pre-built Automation\",\n  \"author\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"license\": \"Apache-2.0\",\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"gitlab\",\n    \"hostname\": \"gitlab.com\",\n    \"path\": \"/path/to/my/prebuilts-repo\"\n  },\n  \"IAPDependencies\": {\n    \"@itential/app-automation_catalog\": \"2.5.4\",\n    \"@itential/app-json_forms\": \"1.13.5\",\n    \"@itential/app-workflow_engine\": \"6.7.10\"\n  }\n}\nartifact.json\nThe\nartifact.json\nfile is the most important aspect of the Pre-built Automation.
